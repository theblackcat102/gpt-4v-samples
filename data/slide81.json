SFV's deep integration with the Chinese internet user base, having surpassed 1 billion users, indicating its mainstream acceptance and potential for marketing and sales.\r\n2. Live streaming e-commerce has reached 6.0% of total viewers, showing that a significant portion of consumers are engaging with this form of shopping.\r\n3. The user base for various online channels, such as total e-commerce, online video, SFV, and live streaming, is detailed in bar graphs, showing substantial numbers and growth.\r\n4. Livestreaming shopper penetration is rising, as demonstrated by the graph depicting an increase in e-commerce live streaming as a percentage of total live streaming users from 2019 to 2021.\r\n5. The commentary that 20% of Chinese consumers are \"impulsive spenders\" aligns them with interactive and immediate shopping formats like live streaming and SFV.\r\n6. A comparative analysis of impulsiveness in purchasing behavior among Chinese consumers versus those in the US and South Korea.\r\n7. A pie chart displays the percentage of livestream viewers on SFV platforms versus e-commerce platform total users, with platforms like Douyin and Kuaishou showing higher SFV engagement compared to e-commerce giants like Taobao and JD.\r\n\r\nOverall, the slide suggests a trend where SFV and live streaming are not only popular but are also becoming integral to online shopping behavior in China, particularly among the younger, digitally native population who are prone to making spontaneous purchases. This trend is relevant for businesses, marketers, and investors focusing on e-commerce and digital media strategies in China."
