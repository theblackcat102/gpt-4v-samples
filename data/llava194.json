        "gpt": "Multiple street signs on a single pole often indicate an intersection or junction of two or more roads. The names on the signs typically represent the names of the streets or avenues that meet at that point. Additionally, the presence of such signs can indicate traffic directions, regulations, or important information for drivers and pedestrians to follow at that particular location."

        "gpt": "The image showcases a street sign pole set against a backdrop of a sky filled with white clouds scattered across a pale blue canvas. Two distinct street signs are affixed to the pole, crossing each other to form a rough \"T\" shape. \r\n\r\nThe horizontal sign is prominently labeled with the text \"N OAKWOOD AVE\" in bold, dark lettering, contrasting sharply against its white background. The design of the sign is simplistic, featuring a long rectangular shape with rounded corners. The \"N\" before \"OAKWOOD AVE\" likely indicates the northern direction of the avenue.\r\n\r\nDirectly above this sign, a thin metallic arrow, pointing to the left, displays the text \"AZLE ST\". The style and coloration of this sign mimic the horizontal one, with bold, dark characters set against a pristine white backdrop.\r\n\r\nBelow the \"N OAKWOOD AVE\" sign, there's another white rectangular sign. It prominently displays the word \"NO\" in black bold letters. The stark contrast between the text and the background ensures visibility even from a distance.\r\n\r\nThe pole supporting these signs appears to be made of metal, exhibiting a silvery hue that contrasts with the greenish canopy of trees in the distant background. The trees, though slightly blurred, suggest a suburban or semi-urban setting.\r\n\r\nLastly, a tiny red dot, possibly an insect or a small artifact, is visible on the lower \"NO\" sign, adding a touch of organic irregularity to the otherwise man-made structure."
