    "gpt": "The slide you've presented appears to be a financial forecast related to EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) and Free Cash Flow for a company from 2021E to 2026E, where \"E\" stands for \"Estimate\". Here's a breakdown of the components:\r\n\r\n**Top Section - EBITDA Forecast:**\r\n- This portion shows the projected EBITDA from 2021 to 2026 in millions of dollars.\r\n- The company is expecting negative EBITDA in 2021E (-$156 million), 2022E (-$151 million), and 2023E (-$17 million).\r\n- A positive EBITDA is projected starting in 2024E ($229 million), increasing in 2025E ($504 million), and further in 2026E ($854 million).\r\n- Alongside the numerical forecasts, there are black bar charts visualizing the growth of EBITDA from a negative to a positive value over the years.\r\n- There are also percentage margins given for 2024E (25%), 2025E (32%), and 2026E (41%), which might represent the EBITDA margin as a percentage of revenue or sales.\r\n\r\n**Bottom Section - Free Cash Flow Forecast (EBITDA - Capex +\/\u2212 Change in Working Capital):**\r\n- The lower portion of the slide provides a view of the Free Cash Flow (FCF), which is a measure of financial performance calculated as EBITDA minus capital expenditures (Capex) and adjusted for changes in Working Capital (WC).\r\n- This section shows that the company anticipates a significant cash need of approximately $420 million from the second half of 2021 onwards.\r\n- Negative free cash flow is estimated for 2021E (-$155 million), 2022E (-$222 million), and 2023E (-$120 million). This is depicted with red bars, indicating an outflow of cash.\r\n- Positive free cash flow is expected to start in 2024E ($90 million), with a substantial increase in 2025E ($547 million), and further growth in 2026E ($889 million), illustrated with increasingly taller red bars, indicating cash inflow.\r\n\r\n**Key Notes on the Right Side:**\r\n- The company expects to achieve positive EBITDA by 2024.\r\n- It attributes future success to learning curve effects, Design for Manufacturing and Assembly (DFMA) techniques, economies of scale, cost optimization, and volume production, which are expected to enable approximately 40% or more EBITDA margins at scale.\r\n- The company also aims to achieve positive free cash flow by 2024.\r\n- The forecast includes the effect of favorable working capital dynamics due to customer pre-payments as part of Launch Services Agreements, which allow for pre-payments 12-18 months in advance.\r\n\r\nOverall, the slide is meant to provide a financial outlook indicating the company's expectations of turning from a loss-making to a profit-making status over the given forecast period, with improving EBITDA and free cash flow figures."
