The graph displayed is a line graph with two lines, each representing different data sets over various years.\r\n\r\nBelow the graph, there's a table with two rows of data, which seems to be summarizing the latest data point on the graph:\r\n\r\n1. **\u589E\u578B\u8ABF\u6574\u55AE\u50F9(\u4E0D\u542B\u7A05\u512A\u5929)**: This translates to \"Adjusted unit price increase (excluding tax benefits)\", and it is listed at 106.4 \u6BCF\u5143\/\u5E73, which could be interpreted as \"per unit\/square meter\" or a similar unit of measure depending on the context.\r\n\r\n2. **\u589E\u578B\u8ABF\u6574\u55AE\u50F9(\u5927\u5EC8)**: This translates to \"Adjusted unit price increase (Building)\", which also lists 106.4 \u6BCF\u5143\/\u5E73, indicating a similar measure for a building specifically.\r\n\r\nFor both of these entries, there are two percentages given:\r\n\r\n- **\u589E\u9577\u4E0A\u4E00\u5B63**: \"Growth over the previous quarter\", which is 8.60%.\r\n- **\u589E\u9577\u53BB\u5E74\u540C\u5B63**: \"Growth over the same quarter last year\", which is 18.22%.\r\n\r\nThe years listed on the X-axis of the graph appear to be broken into two series: 1901-1904 and 2001-2021, which likely corresponds to the two lines on the graph, but without more context or seeing the legend, it's unclear what these two time series are representing. However, given the context provided by the summary table, these lines could represent historical data and forecasts\/projections for the adjusted unit price increase, possibly for different markets or different types of property, before and after a certain event or policy implementation.\r\n\r\nThe use of '1901-1904' could be a placeholder, error, or represent a different coding for fiscal years, periods, or quarters, not necessarily calendar years.\r\n\r\nWithout additional context or the ability to see the full slide and presentation, this is a high-level interpretation of the visual data provided."
