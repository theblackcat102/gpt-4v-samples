        "gpt": "A surfer in this setting might experience the following difficulties:\r\n\r\n1. Rocky Terrain: The presence of rocks can pose a danger to surfers as they can get injured if they hit them or if their surfboard gets damaged upon contact.\r\n \r\n2. Wave Breaks Near Rocks: Waves breaking near or onto the rocks can be treacherous. A surfer may be pushed towards the rocks by the wave, increasing the risk of injury.\r\n\r\n3. Riptides and Currents: The presence of rocks can create unpredictable water movements, including riptides or strong currents, which can pull a surfer out to sea or towards other hazards.\r\n\r\n4. Uneven Surf: The combination of waves, rocks, and currents can lead to uneven or choppy surf, making it challenging to ride or catch waves consistently.\r\n\r\n5. Limited Escape Routes: In case of a wipeout or if caught by a large wave, the presence of rocks might limit the surfer's escape routes, potentially trapping them against the rocks.\r\n\r\n6. Surfboard Damage: The rocks can damage the surfboard, either by direct contact or by getting caught between waves and rocks.\r\n\r\n7. Limited Space: The surfer might have limited space to maneuver due to the proximity of the rocks, making it essential to choose the right wave and path.\r\n\r\n8. Sea Life: Rocky areas can be habitats for various marine life, some of which might be harmful, like sea urchins or sharp-shelled creatures.\r\n\r\n9. Difficulty in Entering and Exiting: The rocky terrain can make it challenging for surfers to enter or exit the water safely, especially during high tide or rough conditions.\r\n\r\n10. Visibility: Depending on the time of day or water clarity, rocks submerged beneath the surface might not be easily visible, posing an unexpected hazard.\r\n\r\nIt's crucial for surfers to be familiar with the conditions and hazards of a particular surfing spot and to take precautions to ensure their safety."
