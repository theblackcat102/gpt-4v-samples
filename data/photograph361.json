    {"gpt": "The image shows a group of Japanese macaques, commonly known as \"snow monkeys.\" They are bathing in a hot spring, a behavior they've adopted to stay warm during the cold winter months.\r\n\r\nJapanese macaques are native to Japan and are the northernmost-living non-human primates. They are well-adapted to cold climates and have thick fur to help insulate against the cold. In certain parts of Japan, these monkeys are known to seek out and relax in naturally occurring hot springs (onsens). This behavior is most famously observed in Jigokudani Monkey Park in the Nagano Prefecture of Japan, where tourists and photographers often visit to witness and capture the unique sight of these monkeys enjoying the warm waters against a snowy backdrop. The park has become a popular destination due to this unique spectacle. The monkeys use the hot springs to warm up, especially during the colder months when snow covers the region."}
