A wooden cabinet or vanity with a countertop, below which there seems to be storage space.\r\n3. A circular mirror mounted on the wall above the cabinet.\r\n4. A standing shower with clear glass doors and a white-patterned design on the glass.\r\n5. A stone or brick textured wall that gives the bathroom a rustic appearance.\r\n6. A window that allows natural light to come in, complemented by the sheer white curtains.\r\n7. A plant placed near the window, which adds a touch of greenery to the space.\r\n8. A beige or light brown floor, possibly made of tiles or stone.\r\n9. Towels neatly folded and placed on the countertop.\r\n10. A candle placed beside the bathtub, which could be used for relaxation or to set a calming ambiance.\r\n\r\nOverall, the bathroom has a luxurious and rustic design, combining modern amenities with natural elements."
