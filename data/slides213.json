    "gpt": "The image presents two graphs that compare the well-to-wheel greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the global electric vehicle (EV) fleet under two different scenarios, from 2021 to 2030. The data metrics used in the graphs are measured in millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide-equivalent (Mt CO2-eq), which is a standard unit for comparing emissions from various greenhouse gases based on their global-warming potential.\r\n\r\n**Stated Policies Scenario:**\r\n- This scenario represents the well-to-wheel GHG emissions based on current policies that governments have already enacted.\r\n- The area charts denote the GHG emissions associated with different types of electric vehicles and the emissions displaced by replacing internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles with EVs.\r\n- Colored areas represent:\r\n  - Electric two\/three wheelers (light blue)\r\n  - Electric trucks (orange)\r\n  - Electric buses (gray)\r\n  - Electric LDVs (light-duty vehicles) (dark blue)\r\n  - Displaced ICE two\/three wheelers (light orange)\r\n  - Displaced ICE trucks (light gray)\r\n  - Displaced ICE buses (yellow)\r\n  - Displaced ICE LDVs (dark orange)\r\n- The red dots represent the net avoided GHG emissions, which are the reductions in emissions achieved by the EV fleet compared to an equivalent fleet of ICE vehicles.\r\n\r\n**Announced Pledges Scenario:**\r\n- This scenario depicts the potential well-to-wheel GHG emissions from the EV fleet if all announced pledges by governments and industry stakeholders are fully implemented.\r\n- Similar to the Stated Policies Scenario, the area chart shows the emissions from electric mobility and the displaced emissions from conventional vehicles.\r\n- The data metrics and color coding are consistent with the Stated Policies Scenario, with the same categories for types of vehicles.\r\n\r\n**Common Elements in Both Scenarios:**\r\n- The y-axis shows the GHG emissions in Mt CO2-eq, ranging from -1,000 to 600 Mt.\r\n- The x-axis represents time, from 2021 to 2030.\r\n- Both scenarios show that as time progresses, the avoided emissions (represented by the red dots) increase, suggesting that the transition to EVs is expected to have a growing impact on reducing GHG emissions over the years.\r\n\r\nThe note at the bottom clarifies that the positive emissions come from the EV fleet and the associated electricity production for these vehicles, while negative emissions are those that would have been emitted by an equivalent ICE vehicle fleet. It also explains that the vehicle manufacturing emissions are not included. These graphs aim to visualize the emissions savings from EVs compared to ICE vehicles and provide insight into how different policies and pledges can influence these savings."
