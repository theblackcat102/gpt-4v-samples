    {"gpt": "This chart is illustrating the annual revenue generated from consumer fireworks over a period of time, specifically from the year 1998 to 2018. Here are the key takeaways from the chart:\r\n\r\n1. **Type of Data**: The data presented is about the yearly revenue from consumer fireworks. The values are represented in million USD.\r\n\r\n2. **Two Types of Fireworks**: The chart distinguishes between two categories of fireworks \u2013 \"Consumer\" and \"Display\". \r\n   \r\n   - \"Consumer\" fireworks likely refer to those fireworks that are purchased and used by individual consumers.\r\n   - \"Display\" fireworks might refer to professional-grade fireworks used for large public or private events.\r\n\r\n3. **Trend Over Time**: \r\n   \r\n   - The revenue from \"Consumer\" fireworks has seen a significant increase over the years. Starting from just below 300 million USD in 1998, it has surged to 945 million USD in 2018.\r\n   - The revenue from \"Display\" fireworks has experienced a more gradual increase. It began at around 141 million USD in 1998 and reached 360 million USD in 2018.\r\n\r\n4. **Title's Implication**: The title \"Consumer Fireworks Revenue Is Exploding\" is a play on words. While \"exploding\" can be a literal reference to the nature of fireworks, in this context, it metaphorically signifies the substantial growth in revenue over the time period presented.\r\n\r\n5. **Data Source**: The data is sourced from the \"American Pyrotechnics Association\", suggesting that the numbers are likely specific to the United States.\r\n\r\nFrom this chart, you should understand that the market for consumer fireworks in the United States has seen substantial growth over the past two decades, with the revenue from consumer fireworks greatly outpacing that of display fireworks by 2018."}
