If someone needs to use the sink for washing their face, brushing their teeth, or any other morning activities, the cat being in the sink would prevent them from doing so. They would need to move the cat, which could take time and possibly upset the cat. Additionally, cat hair or dander left in the sink could contaminate items or surfaces that come into contact with it."
