    "gpt": "This image presents two bar charts that detail venture-backed exit activity in Asia from 2014 through 2022. The exit activity is categorized into three types: Acquisition, Buyout, and Public Listing.\r\n\r\nThe first chart on the left shows the number of exits, indicated by the label \"Venture-backed exit activity (#) by type in Asia.\" Here, exits are counted in absolute numbers. Each bar is divided into three segments representing the three types of exit activities:\r\n\r\n1. **Acquisition:** This is when a company is purchased by another entity. The corresponding segments are colored black in the bars.\r\n2. **Buyout:** This typically involves investors purchasing a controlling interest in a company. The corresponding segments are colored in a darker blue.\r\n3. **Public Listing:** This refers to a company going public, often through an Initial Public Offering (IPO). These segments are shown in light blue.\r\n\r\nIn this bar chart, public listings seem to dominate the exit activity, particularly in the years 2018 and 2021.\r\n\r\nThe second chart on the right displays \"Venture-backed exit activity ($B) by type in Asia,\" where the exit activities are quantified in billions of dollars. This reflects the financial value of the exits rather than their quantity. The color coding is the same as the first chart:\r\n\r\n- **Acquisition:** Shown in black.\r\n- **Buyout:** Shown in dark blue.\r\n- **Public Listing:** Shown in light blue.\r\n\r\nThis chart highlights a significant spike in the value of public listings in 2021, vastly exceeding the values for acquisitions and buyouts. The data suggests that while there might not always be a high number of public listings, the financial impact of those listings is substantial when they do occur.\r\n\r\nBoth charts include a note that indicates the data is relevant up to 2022 and was sourced from \"Venture Pulse, Q3'22, Global Analysis of Venture Funding, KPMG Private Enterprise\" as of September 30, 2022, and provided by PitchBook on October 19, 2022.\r\n\r\nIt's important to note that the data for 2022 is likely to be partial, as suggested by the asterisk and the label \"2022*\" on the x-axes of both charts, indicating that the full year's data might not have been complete at the time of the report."
