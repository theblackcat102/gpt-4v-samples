        "gpt": "When skateboarding to prevent injuries, these kids should:\r\n\r\n1. Wear protective gear:\r\n   - Helmet: A properly fitting helmet that covers the back of the head is crucial.\r\n   - Wrist guards: To protect from fractures.\r\n   - Knee and elbow pads: To prevent cuts, bruises, and abrasions.\r\n   - Closed shoes with flat soles: This provides better grip on the skateboard.\r\n   - Padded jackets and shorts can also be considered for extra protection.\r\n\r\n2. Use a skateboard suitable for their skill level and the type of skateboarding they're doing.\r\n\r\n3. Ensure the skateboard is in good condition. Regularly check for any issues such as cracks in the board or problems with the wheels or bearings.\r\n\r\n4. Practice in safe areas:\r\n   - Begin in open areas free from traffic and obstacles.\r\n   - Avoid busy streets, especially if they're not experienced.\r\n   - Use skate parks designed for skateboarding.\r\n\r\n5. Learn to fall:\r\n   - When losing balance, try to crouch down to reduce the height of the fall.\r\n   - Avoid putting hands straight out when falling to prevent wrist injuries.\r\n   - Try to roll when hitting the ground to reduce impact.\r\n\r\n6. Learn the basics first:\r\n   - Before trying tricks, master basic skills like turning, stopping, and controlling speed.\r\n\r\n7. Avoid using headphones while skateboarding to stay aware of surroundings.\r\n\r\n8. Skateboard during daylight or in well-lit areas if at night.\r\n\r\n9. Avoid skateboarding in wet or slippery conditions.\r\n\r\n10. Always be aware of surroundings, watching out for pedestrians, traffic, and obstacles.\r\n\r\n11. Practice with supervision, especially if they're beginners.\r\n\r\n12. Take breaks and avoid pushing beyond their limits, as fatigue can lead to mistakes and injuries.\r\n\r\n13. Consider taking lessons from professional instructors to learn proper techniques and safety tips."
