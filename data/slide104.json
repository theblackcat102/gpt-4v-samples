    "gpt": "The analytics depicted here outline the process and benefits of a long-term frame agreement with recurring revenues and show example framework contracts in NOK million (Norwegian Krone millions). The slide indicates that these agreements provide a structured approach to meeting client needs, setting up agreements, and delivering on those agreements, with the possibility of additional upside in revenue streams. The process involves three main stages:\r\n\r\n1. **Client has a specific need**: The first stage involves understanding and deciding on the client's requirements.\r\n2. **Setup of frame agreement**: This stage is about establishing the financial and temporal scope of the agreement.\r\n3. **Delivery on frame agreement**: The final stage entails the actual delivery of services and products as per the agreement.\r\n\r\nThe graph below the stages shows original budget versus actual value for specific contracts, indicating that the actual usage\/value is often equal to or exceeds the original budget, which suggests a low-risk profile and potential for revenue growth.\r\n\r\nActions generally prompted by such analytics could include:\r\n\r\n- **Reviewing and adjusting budgets**: Since the actual values often meet or exceed the original budgets, there might be a need to adjust the budgets or the frame agreements to align with actual spending and to capture additional revenue opportunities.\r\n  \r\n- **Negotiating new frame agreements**: With the success shown in current agreements, there may be opportunities to enter into additional agreements with existing or new clients.\r\n  \r\n- **Evaluating the delivery process**: Ensuring the company can sustainably meet the demands of these agreements by possibly scaling operations, enhancing training, or expanding the product portfolio.\r\n  \r\n- **Strategic planning**: Using this data for forecasting and strategic planning to manage resources effectively and plan for future growth.\r\n  \r\n- **Risk management**: Although the implication is of low risk, the data could be used to further mitigate risks by analyzing why actual values are in line with or above the budget and ensuring that this can be maintained.\r\n\r\nThe analytics seem to be used as a tool to inform stakeholders about the performance and stability of revenue streams from these long-term agreements, and to guide decision-making regarding client relationships, financial planning, and operational capacity."
