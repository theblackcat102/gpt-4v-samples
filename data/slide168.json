    "gpt": "The image shows a bar chart representing Qualcomm's quarterly total reported device sales, measured in billions of dollars. Below are the clarifications of the data metrics and elements presented:\r\n\r\n1. **Bar Chart**: Each bar represents the sales in billions of dollars for a specific quarter. Starting from Q3 in September 2010 with sales of $34.0 billion, the chart progresses sequentially through to Q3 in September 2013, where sales are estimated (indicated by the \"e\" after the number) to be between $57.5 billion and $63.5 billion. The bars increase over time, showing growth in sales.\r\n\r\n2. **Timeline**: The x-axis represents time, with labels for the year and quarter of the report\u2014ranging from September 2010 (Sep '10) through September 2013 (Sep '13).\r\n\r\n3. **Sales Values**: The y-axis indicates the sales amount in billions of dollars. It's important to note that the final bar for September 2013 is not a single value but an estimated range, which is likely why it is colored differently.\r\n\r\n4. **Estimated Average Selling Price (Est. ASP)**: This is provided for each quarter below the bars. The estimated average selling price is given as a range, for instance, from $201-$207 for September 2010. This figure helps to understand the average price of devices sold in that quarter.\r\n\r\n5. **Estimated Shipments (Est. Shipments)**: Next to the estimated average selling price, the estimated number of shipments is also provided as a range. For September 2010, this was 165-169 million units.\r\n\r\n6. **Footnote References**: The numbers in circles (4) and (5) next to the title \"Quarterly total reported device sales\" suggest that there is additional information or disclaimers provided on the footnotes page at the end of the presentation. This often includes information on how the data was collected, any assumptions made, or specific definitions used.\r\n\r\n7. **Top Header Information**: Above the chart, there are bullet points indicating the number of licensees Qualcomm has for different technologies:\r\n\r\n   - **250+ CDMA-based licensees**: This implies Qualcomm has over 250 licensees for its CDMA technology.\r\n   - **175+ licensed for WCDMA\/TD-SCDMA**: Indicates there are over 175 licensees for WCDMA (Wideband Code Division Multiple Access) and TD-SCDMA (Time Division Synchronous Code Division Multiple Access) technologies.\r\n   - **90+ royalty-bearing single-mode OFDM\/OFDMA licensees**: Shows that there are over 90 licensees for OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing)\/OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiple Access) that bear royalties on a single-mode basis.\r\n\r\nThese bullet points provide context on the diversity and scope of Qualcomm's licensing agreements, which contribute to the sales figures represented by the bars. \r\n\r\nThis bar chart serves as a visual representation to communicate the company's sales performance over time, the average selling prices of their devices, and the volume of shipments. It would be used internally for performance tracking or externally to inform investors and stakeholders about the company's financial health and market performance."
