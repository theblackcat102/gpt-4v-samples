        "gpt": "The chart displays perceptions of the impact of technology companies on the country over time. Here are the observations:\r\n\r\n1. **Overall Perception**: \r\n   - The percentage of people who perceive the impact of technology companies as positive has increased from 68% in 2010 to 71% in 2019.\r\n   - Conversely, the percentage of people who view the impact as negative has decreased from 18% in 2010 to 17% in 2015, but it then significantly increased to 33% in 2019.\r\n\r\n2. **Party-wise Perception**:\r\n   - For those who identify as \"Dem\/Lean Dem\": \r\n     - Their positive perception about technology companies started at 66% in 2010, peaked at 74% in 2015, and then slightly decreased to 72% in 2019.\r\n   - For those who identify as \"Rep\/Lean Rep\":\r\n     - Their positive perception began at 69% in 2010, decreased to 54% in 2019 with the lowest at 44% in 2015.\r\n     \r\n3. **Differences Between Parties**:\r\n   - While both parties had similar positive views in 2010 (66% for Dem\/Lean Dem and 69% for Rep\/Lean Rep), by 2019, there's a noticeable gap between the two groups, with 72% of Dem\/Lean Dem having a positive view compared to 54% of Rep\/Lean Rep.\r\n\r\n4. **General Trend**:\r\n   - The percentage of people holding a positive view about the impact of tech companies has been relatively stable or decreasing slightly.\r\n   - Negative perceptions about tech companies, particularly from 2015 to 2019, have increased significantly.\r\n\r\nIn summary, while the positive perception of tech companies' impact remains dominant, there's a growing number of people, especially among the Rep\/Lean Rep group, who view their impact negatively. The increasing trend in negative perceptions over recent years suggests growing concerns or skepticism about tech companies in the country."
