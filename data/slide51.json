    "gpt": "The slide presents an analysis of the ambition levels of various countriesâ€™ Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, based on different metrics. It seeks to compare how these commitments measure up in terms of emission reductions relative to baseline years, emission intensity improvements, and the required abatement from a business-as-usual scenario to meet their targets. The overarching theme is to evaluate and compare the relative commitment and effort put forth by different countries in addressing climate change through their pledged emission reduction goals. It also provides a snapshot of which countries are leading in terms of ambitious climate targets and which are seen as less ambitious."
