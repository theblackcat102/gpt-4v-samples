        "gpt": "Zebras might be in an enclosure for several reasons:\r\n\r\n1. They are in a zoo or wildlife park where animals are kept for public viewing.\r\n2. The enclosure provides a safe environment, protecting them from potential predators or poaching.\r\n3. It's a conservation effort, where endangered or vulnerable species are protected and bred to increase their numbers.\r\n4. The enclosure is part of a research facility where scientists study zebras' behavior, health, or genetics.\r\n5. They are in a sanctuary or rehabilitation center where injured or orphaned zebras are cared for before being released back into the wild.\r\n6. The area could be a temporary holding facility, for instance, while their primary habitat is being prepared or renovated.\r\n7. It's a controlled environment where zebras can be cared for, fed, and monitored regularly by professionals."
