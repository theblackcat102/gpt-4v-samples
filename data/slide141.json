While operational efficiency and technology adoption remain top priorities, there's a notable future emphasis on market growth. This suggests a strategic shift from internal process optimization to external market expansion.\r\n\r\nThe survey population for these insights is noted at the bottom, indicating that 77 SMEs (Small and Medium-sized Enterprises) were surveyed for the current state and future objectives."
