    {"gpt": "This diagram is a floor plan for a residential property. It outlines a layout with multiple rooms and designates the placement of furniture, fixtures, and appliances. Here\u2019s a detailed description of the layout and contents:\r\n\r\n- **Foyer**: The entryway to the home, with space allocated for a shoe rack or cabinet.\r\n- **Living Room**: A sizable area furnished with a sofa set, including a coffee table, facing a TV unit. The living room provides access to a balcony area.\r\n- **Dining**: Adjacent to the living room, there\u2019s a space for a dining table set centrally located in the room.\r\n- **Master Bedroom**: This room contains a large bed, side tables, and a wardrobe. It has an attached bathroom, which includes a WC, basin, and shower area, and there's access to a balcony.\r\n- **Bedroom 2**: Furnished with a bed, side table, and wardrobe. It has a common\/shared bathroom access which is equipped with a WC, basin, and shower.\r\n- **Bedroom 3**: Similar to Bedroom 2 with a bed, side tables, and a wardrobe. This room also has an attached balcony.\r\n- **Common Bathroom**: Accessible from the corridor, featuring a WC, basin, and shower.\r\n- **Kitchen**: The kitchen has counters on two walls and space for a refrigerator, as well as an adjoining utility area. There's a secondary, smaller kitchen or a service area called the \"Dry\/Wet Kitchen\" adjacent to it.\r\n- **Dry\/Wet Kitchen**: A supplementary area connected to the main kitchen, likely intended for heavy-duty cooking or washing, keeping the main kitchen less cluttered and more presentable.\r\n- **Store**: A small storage room adjacent to the Dry\/Wet Kitchen.\r\n- **Private Lobby**: Acts as a buffer space or additional privacy area before entering the main residential area from the foyer.\r\n- **AC Ledge**: An external space probably designated for the installation of air conditioning units.\r\n- **Balconies**: Three balcony areas are shown, providing outdoor access from the living room and two of the bedrooms.\r\n\r\nThe plan also illustrates the placement of doors, windows, and circulation paths within the space. The overall design suggests a focus on privacy, with a private lobby separating the entrance from the living areas, and the positioning of bedrooms to ensure individual privacy. The inclusion of multiple balconies also suggests an emphasis on outdoor access and natural light."}
