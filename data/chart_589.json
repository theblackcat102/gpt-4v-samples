According to the chart:\r\n- There are a total of 713 superdelegates.\r\n- 193 of them are U.S. Representatives.\r\n- 47 are U.S. Senators.\r\n- 21 are Governors.\r\n- 20 are Distinguished party leaders.\r\n- 432 are DNC members.\r\nThe notes also mention that there are four vacant DNC positions not shown in the chart and that some of the governors, senators, and representatives are also DNC members; hence they are categorized by elective office only. The data source is the Pew Research Center."
