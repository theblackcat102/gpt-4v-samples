        "gpt": "The primary message of the graph is that Tea Party Republicans have consistently retained warm feelings towards Donald Trump over the years 2016-2018. This is evidenced by the higher ratings on a 0-100 'feeling thermometer' among Republicans who agreed with the Tea Party, as compared to those who had no opinion or disagreed with the Tea Party. Specifically, Republicans who agreed with the Tea Party consistently rated Trump higher, with a rating of 78 in 2018, while those who had no opinion rated him at 59 in 2018, and those who disagreed with the Tea Party gave him a rating of 53 in 2018."
