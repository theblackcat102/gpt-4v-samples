    "gpt": "The slide presents a compelling narrative about the aging infrastructure of student housing and the growth opportunities that exist in modernizing these facilities. Here's how you can shape the narrative:\r\n\r\n\"Student housing is at a crossroads, with much of the current infrastructure dating back to the 1950s and '60s, originally designed for the Baby Boom generation. This aging stock, particularly on-campus housing, is now over 50 years old in ACC markets and no longer meets the demands and expectations of today's students.\r\n\r\nThe market is ripe for modernization, as evidenced by the shift toward newer, purpose-built living communities. These modern facilities are not just residences but communities designed to enhance the living and learning experience, reflecting the current educational ethos.\r\n\r\nOff-campus housing is similarly undergoing a transformation. The majority of existing stock is outdated, consisting of low-density alternate housing like single family homes or properties managed by absentee landlords, which were not specifically designed for today's student population.\r\n\r\nSince the mid-1990s, there has been a trend towards the construction of purpose-built communities off-campus. These are tailored to the students' needs, with the majority of early communities being drive properties. However, since 2010, the trend has shifted towards pedestrian communities to facilitate easy access to campus and amenities.\r\n\r\nLooking at the supply in 68 ACC University Markets, we can see that 'Alternate Supply' constitutes 53% of the market, while 'Purpose Built' supply makes up only 25%, with on-campus housing holding a 22% share. This indicates a significant opportunity for growth in the purpose-built sector. The 'Purpose Built' segment is further broken down into 'Drive' at 12% with a median age of 12 years and 'Pedestrian' at 13% with a median age of 7 years.\r\n\r\nThis transition not only promises to meet the evolving demands of modern students but also presents a substantial opportunity for us to invest in and capture a portion of this growing market segment. By focusing on the development of modern, purpose-built student housing, we can stay ahead of the curve and ensure our portfolio remains competitive and attractive to the student market.\""
