    "gpt": "The humor in this meme derives from playing on the stereotype that there is a gender difference in the approach to cosplay. It suggests that girls' cosplay is often elaborate and detailed, aligning with the top image of an anime character, while boys' cosplay is humorously depicted as minimalistic and improvised, as shown in the bottom image where a person uses what appears to be a regular striped sock to mimic the look of a long, knee-high boot, typically worn by anime characters. The contrast between the expected detailed costume and the makeshift sock is meant to be an unexpected and humorous subversion of expectations."
