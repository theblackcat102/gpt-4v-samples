        "gpt": "The image captures a breathtaking night sky, dominated by the dense and sparkling spread of the Milky Way galaxy, which casts a faint, nebulous glow. This celestial marvel contrasts sharply against the inky blackness of the vast expanse. Below the starry canvas, silhouetted mountain peaks rise mysteriously, forming a jagged horizon. Their dark forms provide a stark contrast to the luminous heavens above. There is an ethereal quality to the picture, intensified by the absence of any artificial lighting or human-made structures. The gradation of colors, from the deep blacks and blues of the night to the silvery-whites and grays of the stars, adds depth and dimension, making the viewer feel both humbled by the infinite cosmos and connected to the serene, untouched earth below. There are no discernible words in the image."
