    "gpt": "The slide you've presented is titled \"Successful execution of official data strategy proves concept\" and contains a bar chart with additional notations to indicate the progression of events covered by official rights from 2014 to a forecasted value in 2020.\r\n\r\nHere's a breakdown of the elements on the slide:\r\n\r\n- **Bar Chart**: This is used to show the number of events covered by official rights over the years. Each bar represents a year, and the height of the bar indicates the quantity of events.\r\n\r\n- **2014**: There's a small bar representing 1,000 events offered with official rights.\r\n  \r\n- **2015**: The bar shows an increase to 38,000 events.\r\n  \r\n- **2016**: Further increase to 45,000 events.\r\n  \r\n- **2017**: Significant growth to 70,000 events.\r\n  \r\n- **2018**: Continued growth to 104,000 events.\r\n  \r\n- **2019**: Further increase to 147,000 events.\r\n\r\n- **2020F**: The bar for 2020 is dashed, indicating it is a forecast rather than actual data, with a forecasted number of 240,000 events covered. On this bar, there's an additional note \"Of which 110k+ are exclusive,\" which means that out of the 240,000 forecasted events, over 110,000 are exclusive to the organization presenting the data.\r\n\r\n- **Curved Dotted Line**: This starts at the top of the 2019 bar and curves up to the top of the forecasted 2020 bar, illustrating the projected increase in events covered from 2019 to 2020.\r\n\r\n- **Green Circle with Number 2**: This seems to be a part of a legend or key explaining components of the strategy. Number 1 and 2 are listed with the following explanations:\r\n  1. **Acquisition of official rights**: This likely refers to the strategy or actions taken by the company to acquire the rights to official data or events.\r\n  2. **Monetization of official rights**: This refers to the strategies or actions to earn revenue from the rights that have been acquired.\r\n\r\nThe slide suggests that the company, Genius Sports Group, has had a growing number of events each year where it has official rights, and the data up to 2019 shows an upward trend. The forecast for 2020 suggests a significant jump in the number of events covered, with a substantial proportion being exclusive to them, indicating a successful execution of their data strategy, both in terms of acquisition and anticipated monetization of those rights."
