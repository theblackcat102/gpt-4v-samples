    "gpt": "The image displays a set of glass doors with large yellow circular stickers on them. These stickers have a logo that consists of a stylized smiling face with what appears to be a hand gesture on top, resembling a \"thumbs up\" or a waving hand. Below this design, the word \"chocoZAP\" is written in black. The interior of the establishment, although partially visible, is not distinct due to the reflections on the glass. The floor right outside the doors has a circular mat with the same \"chocoZAP\" logo. Outside, there seems to be a tiled pathway and a visible part of a bicycle. The surrounding context or the nature of the business \"chocoZAP\" is not evident from this image alone."
