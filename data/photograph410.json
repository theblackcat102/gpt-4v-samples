    "gpt": "1. Gray Fish Toy: This object resembles a fish, predominantly gray in color with slight scale detailing. It has a pronounced white underbelly and features such as fins, eyes, and a mouth. The tail appears white and slightly frayed at the tip.\r\n\r\n2. Cat: The cat has a mix of white, brown, and dark gray fur. Its body is elongated and snugly fits into the box. The cat's head is turned away, so only the back and part of its side is visible. The cat's ears are upright, and its tail is partially visible at the bottom of the box.\r\n\r\n3. Blue Fish Toy: Similar to the gray fish toy, this object has a fish-like appearance. It's primarily blue with a lighter underbelly. The toy has fins, eyes, and a mouth detail. Unlike the gray fish, this one has a more pronounced dorsal fin and a tail that looks dark and split into two lobes."
