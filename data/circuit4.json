    {"human": "Among the following circuits which circuit has the higher output impedance? and Why?"},
    {"gpt": "The two circuits shown are configurations of series and parallel resistors, representing different ways in which output impedance (Rout) might be affected.\r\n\r\n1. The circuit on the left has resistors connected in parallel.\r\n2. The circuit on the right has resistors connected in series.\r\n\r\nThe output impedance for a series combination of resistors is simply the sum of the resistances:\r\n\\[ R_{out(series)} = R_1 + R_2 + R_3 + ... \\]\r\n\r\nFor a parallel combination of resistors, the reciprocal of the output impedance is the sum of the reciprocals of each resistance:\r\n\\[ \\frac{1}{R_{out(parallel)}} = \\frac{1}{R_1} + \\frac{1}{R_2} + \\frac{1}{R_3} + ... \\]\r\n\r\nGiven the same resistors, a series combination will always have a higher impedance than a parallel combination. Therefore, the circuit on the right with the resistors connected in series has a higher output impedance."}
