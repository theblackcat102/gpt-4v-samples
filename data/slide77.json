    "gpt": "The slide presents a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial metrics for the years ending December 31 of 2017, 2018, and 2019, illustrating the adjustments made to GAAP figures to arrive at non-GAAP figures such as EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization), Adjusted EBITDA, and Free Cash Flow.\r\n\r\nHere's how you can use the information on this slide to make better decisions:\r\n\r\n1. **Trend Analysis:**\r\n   - **Net Profit\/Loss:** You can assess the profitability trend of the company. The GAAP Net Profit\/(Loss) shows a consistent loss that is increasing annually from 2017 to 2019.\r\n   - **EBITDA:** By looking at EBITDA, you can evaluate the company's operating performance without the costs of capital structure and tax regime. An increasing negative EBITDA could be concerning.\r\n   - **Adjusted EBITDA:** This metric adds back certain items to EBITDA, providing a view of the company's operating performance with certain non-recurring costs excluded. You can see whether the adjustments make a significant impact on the company's perceived profitability.\r\n\r\n2. **Cost Management:**\r\n   - Review the line items added back to net profit\/loss, such as Depreciation & Amortization and Stock Compensation. How do these expenses trend over time, and what does that say about the company's investment in assets or compensation strategy?\r\n\r\n3. **Understanding Non-Operating Factors:**\r\n   - Analyze the \"Other Expense\/(Income)\" and \"Income Expense\/(Tax Benefit)\" adjustments to understand how non-operational factors are impacting the company\u2019s financials.\r\n\r\n4. **Cash Flow Analysis:**\r\n   - Evaluate the Free Cash Flow to understand how much cash the company is generating from its operating activities after accounting for capital expenditures (Capex). This can give insights into the liquidity of the company and its ability to fund operations, pay debt, or invest in growth.\r\n\r\n5. **Financial Health and Investment Decisions:**\r\n   - Investors and creditors might look at Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow to make decisions about investing in or lending to the company. Consistently negative free cash flow, for example, might indicate a potential liquidity issue.\r\n\r\n6. **Budgeting and Forecasting:**\r\n   - If you are part of the company's management or finance team, these metrics can help in budgeting and forecasting. Understanding the historical trends can guide future financial planning and potential areas for cost savings or investment.\r\n\r\n7. **Performance Bonuses and Compensation:**\r\n   - Management and stakeholders might use Adjusted EBITDA figures to assess performance for bonuses or compensation packages, excluding one-time costs that are deemed non-recurring.\r\n\r\n8. **Negotiation with Suppliers or Clients:**\r\n   - The company\u2019s financial health, as indicated by these metrics, can be leveraged in negotiations to secure better terms with suppliers or clients.\r\n\r\n9. **Risk Assessment:**\r\n   - The trends shown might indicate increasing risk if losses are widening. This could inform risk management strategies and contingency planning.\r\n\r\n10. **Comparison with Peers:**\r\n    - Compare these metrics with those of peer companies to assess competitive standing. Are the adjustments typical in the industry, or is this company an outlier?\r\n\r\nRemember, non-GAAP metrics should be used in conjunction with GAAP measures to get a full picture of financial health. They can sometimes be subject to manipulation as they are not standardized, so understanding why and how adjustments are made is crucial."
