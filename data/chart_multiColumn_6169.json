        "gpt": "The chart titled \"Intermarriage Trend, 1980-2010\" displays the percentage of marriages involving spouses of a different race or ethnicity from each other. The following patterns can be observed from the chart:\r\n\r\n1. There has been a consistent increase in the percentage of intermarriages over the three decades from 1980 to 2010.\r\n2. In 1980, the percentage of intermarriages was around 3.2% for all marriages and 6.7% for new marriages.\r\n3. By 2010, the percentage had increased to approximately 8.4% for all marriages and 15.1% for new marriages.\r\n4. The percentage of intermarriages for new marriages is consistently higher than the percentage for all marriages throughout the period.\r\n5. The gap between the percentage of intermarriages in new marriages and all marriages has widened over the years, suggesting that newer generations are more open to intermarriage.\r\n6. The growth rate of intermarriage for new marriages from 1980 to 2010 is steeper than that for all marriages. This indicates that the acceptance or prevalence of intermarriage has accelerated in recent years, especially among new marriages.\r\n7. The period between 1990 and 2000 shows a noticeable increase in the rate of intermarriage for both categories, with a slightly slower growth rate from 2000 to 2010."
