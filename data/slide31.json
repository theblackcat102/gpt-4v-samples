    "gpt": "The primary focus of this slide is to show the rapid growth in deliveries for a company, detailing three key financial metrics over time: Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) before inter-company transactions, Adjusted Net Revenue as a percentage of GMV before inter-company transactions, and Segment EBITDA1 as a percentage of Adjusted Net Revenue, also before inter-company transactions. It presents both historical (actual) data from 2018 to 2020 and projected figures for 2021 to 2023. The slide aims to demonstrate an upward trajectory in the companyâ€™s financial performance, particularly emphasizing the significant compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in GMV, the expected stabilization of the take rate in Adjusted Net Revenue, and a projected improvement in Segment EBITDA1 margins."
