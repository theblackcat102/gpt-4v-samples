Behind the primary jet, to the left, there's a larger aircraft with twin engines.\r\n3. To the right of the primary jet, there's a tail fin visible, which belongs to another aircraft.\r\n\r\nAdding them up: 1 primary jet + 1 twin-engine jet + 1 jet indicated by the tail fin = 3 jets in total.\r\n\r\nSo, there are three jets visible on the tarmac in the image."
