    {"human": "What's funny about this image?"},
    {"gpt": "The humor in this image comes from the juxtaposition of the announcement and the comment. Someone named \"Prashanth\" has shared an update on their social media profile stating \"Got married\" as a celebratory life event. In response, \"Kareem\" comments, \"Pls don't share ur personal problems here,\" humorously treating the marriage announcement as if it's a complaint or problem. The joke lies in the unexpected and playful interpretation of what is typically seen as a positive life event."}
