        "gpt": "The cat might be curious about the unfamiliar objects, the smells associated with the luggage, or simply seeking a new spot to explore or hide in. Cats are naturally curious creatures and are often drawn to investigate new or changed items in their environment. Additionally, if the luggage has been on a trip, it might carry scents from different places, which can be intriguing to the cat. Another possibility is that the cat associates the luggage with its owner's departure or return and may be reacting to that."
