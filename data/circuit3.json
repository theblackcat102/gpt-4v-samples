    {"gpt": "To find the current in the 4 k\u03A9 resistor, we must first determine the state of the diode: whether it is ON or OFF.\r\n\r\nGiven:\r\n1. \\( V_{ON} \\) for the diode = 0.7 V.\r\n2. Source current = 1 mA.\r\n\r\nWhen the diode is OFF:\r\nThe 2 k\u03A9 and 4 k\u03A9 resistors are in series, so the total resistance will be 6 k\u03A9. The current through this series combination is 1 mA. So, the voltage drop across the 2 k\u03A9 resistor will be:\r\n\\( V = IR = 1mA \\times 2k\u03A9 = 2V \\).\r\n\r\nThis means that the voltage at the anode of the diode will be 2V when it's off. Since this is greater than \\( V_{ON} \\), the diode will turn ON.\r\n\r\nWhen the diode is ON:\r\nThe voltage drop across it will be 0.7 V. So, the voltage across the 1 k\u03A9 resistor (which is in parallel with the diode) will also be 0.7 V.\r\n\r\nNow, the voltage drop across the 2 k\u03A9 resistor is:\r\n\\( V_{2k\u03A9} = 1mA \\times 2k\u03A9 = 2V \\).\r\n\r\nSo, the voltage at the node between the 2 k\u03A9 and 1 k\u03A9 resistors will be:\r\n\\( V_{node} = 2V + 0.7V = 2.7V \\).\r\n\r\nUsing the voltage division rule:\r\n\\[ V_{3k\u03A9} = V_{node} \\times \\frac{3k\u03A9}{3k\u03A9 + 6k\u03A9} \\]\r\n\\[ V_{3k\u03A9} = 2.7V \\times \\frac{3}{9} = 0.9V \\]\r\n\r\nNow, the current through the 3 k\u03A9 resistor is:\r\n\\[ I_{3k\u03A9} = \\frac{V_{3k\u03A9}}{3k\u03A9} = \\frac{0.9V}{3k\u03A9} = 0.3 mA \\]\r\n\r\nThis current will also flow through the 4 k\u03A9 resistor, as they are in series.\r\n\r\nSo, the current in the 4 k\u03A9 resistor is 0.3 mA."}
