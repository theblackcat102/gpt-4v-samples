    "gpt": "Floorplan Description:\r\n\r\nLayout: \r\n- The floorplan showcases a multi-bedroom residence. It appears to be a unit within a larger complex, as indicated by the \"TO UNITS #02-74 to #05-74\" notation.\r\n\r\nEntry:\r\n- The main entrance leads directly into a foyer. The foyer acts as a junction point to various parts of the home.\r\n\r\nLiving and Dining Area:\r\n- Directly adjacent to the foyer is the living and dining space. This area is an open-plan design, facilitating flow and movement between the two spaces. A dotted line indicates a strata void above the living and dining space, suggesting a double-height ceiling in these areas.\r\n\r\nKitchen:\r\n- The kitchen is situated beside the living area. It comes equipped with a built-in fridge (F) and a washer\/dryer (WD). \r\n\r\nBalcony:\r\n- A balcony is accessible from the living space, providing outdoor access and potentially a view.\r\n\r\nBedrooms:\r\n- There are two secondary bedrooms labeled \"Bedroom 2.\" Both of these bedrooms have direct access to their respective AC ledges and are of identical design.\r\n- The master bedroom is situated at the opposite end of the layout from the two secondary bedrooms. It has a larger space, an adjoining master bath, and its own AC ledge.\r\n\r\nBathrooms:\r\n- In addition to the master bath, there are two other bathrooms, each located next to one of the \"Bedroom 2\" spaces. All bathrooms appear to have standard amenities.\r\n\r\nAC Ledges:\r\n- There are multiple AC ledges scattered throughout the unit, accessible from various rooms. These ledges are presumably for air-conditioning units or related equipment.\r\n\r\nAdditional Notations:\r\n- Several dividing walls are indicated, which vary in placement depending on the block or floor level. These variances are marked as \"indicative only.\"\r\n- Certain features, such as canopy types and AC ledges at the 1st storey, roof openings above the 5th storey, and others, are subject to variation depending on the specific block within the complex.\r\n\r\nThis floorplan is designed to cater to modern living standards with its open-plan living and dining space, multiple bedrooms, and practical amenities like the washer\/dryer within the kitchen. The presence of balconies and AC ledges adds functionality and comfort for the residents. The multiple bathrooms ensure that even with a full house, amenities are always within reach. This design would cater to a wide range of potential sellers, from families to individuals looking for spacious urban living."
