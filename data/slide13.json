    "gpt": "The image displays a data table, not curves or bar charts. The table represents the growth in Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) per user for different user cohorts over a span of five years. Each cohort is labeled by the year in which the users were acquired, from 2016 to 2019. The GMV is indexed to year 1 for each cohort to facilitate comparison across years.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s what each column signifies:\r\n\r\n- Year 1: This is the baseline year for each cohort, with GMV per user set to 1.00x. It acts as the reference point against which growth in subsequent years is measured.\r\n- Year 2, Year 3, Year 4, and Year 5: These columns show the factor by which the GMV per user has increased relative to the first year. For example, a 1.41x increase means the GMV per user is 41% higher than in the first year.\r\n\r\nObservations from the table include:\r\n\r\n- The 2016 Cohort shows a steady increase from 1.00x in Year 1 to 3.63x in Year 5.\r\n- The 2017 Cohort increased to 2.78x by Year 5.\r\n- The 2018 Cohort reached 2.06x by Year 3, but data for Years 4 and 5 are not shown.\r\n- The 2019 Cohort shows data only for Year 2 at 1.45x.\r\n\r\nThe growth factors highlighted in green signify that these cohorts experienced growth in GMV per user in 2020 despite the impact of COVID-19. This indicates resilience or continued consumer spending in that year for the respective cohorts. \r\n\r\nThe footnote explains that the GMV covers Mobility and Deliveries, excluding non-consumer services such as GrabRentals and GrabKios. This clarification helps to understand that the growth metrics are specific to certain segments of the business."
