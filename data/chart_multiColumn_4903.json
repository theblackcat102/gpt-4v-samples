The importance of controlling gun ownership.\r\n2. The importance of protecting the right of Americans to own guns.\r\n\r\nKey observations:\r\n\r\n- In 1993, a significant majority (57%) believed it was more important to control gun ownership, while 34% believed it was more important to protect the right of Americans to own guns.\r\n- Over time, the gap between these two views narrowed. \r\n- By 2010, the percentage of those prioritizing controlling gun ownership had decreased to 49%, while those prioritizing the protection of gun rights increased to 45%.\r\n- The years following 2010 showed slight fluctuations, but as of 2014, the two views are nearly equal, with 52% favoring control and 46% favoring protection of rights.\r\n\r\nIn summary, from 1993 to 2014, there has been a noticeable shift towards a more even split in public opinion between those who believe in controlling gun ownership and those who believe in protecting the right to own guns."
