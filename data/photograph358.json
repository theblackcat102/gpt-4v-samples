    {"human": "What is this ads trying to convey"},
    {"gpt": "The advertisement is for \"Lumen,\" a dating app for people over 50. The ad features individuals over 50 holding signs that read \"DO YOU SEE US NOW?\" The primary message appears to be challenging societal perceptions that often render older individuals, especially in the context of dating and attractiveness, as \"invisible\" or overlooked. By posing this question, the advertisement seems to confront stereotypes and biases against older individuals, emphasizing that they are present, confident, and deserving of attention and recognition. The tagline, \"Because over 50s should never be made to feel invisible,\" reinforces this idea."}
