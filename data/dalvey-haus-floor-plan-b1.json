    {"gpt": "This diagram is a floor plan of a residential apartment. Here are the details as labeled:\r\n\r\n- There are three bedrooms, labeled \"Bedroom 2,\" \"Bedroom 3,\" and \"Master Bedroom.\" Each bedroom contains a bed, and the Master Bedroom also has an attached \"Master Bathroom\" with a bathtub and a separate shower area, along with a \"Private Closet.\"\r\n- There are two additional bathrooms: one is labeled \"Common Bathroom\" and is accessible via the hallway; the other is the \"Master Bathroom\" mentioned earlier.\r\n- The \"Living Room\" area is furnished with sofas and a coffee table, and it opens up to the \"Dining\" area with a dining table and chairs.\r\n- The \"Dry Kitchen\" is equipped with a counter, presumably with a sink, as well as a refrigerator labeled \"REF.\" There is also a \"Wet Kitchen\" area which likely contains more heavy-duty appliances for cooking, and it has its own \"W.C.\" (water closet or toilet) and \"Store\" room.\r\n- There is an \"AC Ledge\" which is likely a space designated for air conditioning units.\r\n- A \"Foyer\" area serves as the entrance to the apartment.\r\n- There are several utility closets and storage areas dispersed throughout the apartment.\r\n- The \"Private Car Park\" suggests this floor plan includes an integrated private parking space, which might be below the residential unit if the unit is part of a multi-story building.\r\n- Additional features include built-in wardrobes in the bedrooms and various pieces of furniture such as desks and additional seating. \r\n\r\nThe layout is designed to segregate the living and sleeping areas, with wet areas like kitchens and bathrooms placed closer to the service entrance, which is typical in many modern residential designs. The presence of both a dry and wet kitchen suggests the design is catered to accommodate different styles of cooking, possibly in a cultural context where heavy cooking is done separately from lighter or cleaner cooking activities."}
