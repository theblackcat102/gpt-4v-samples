In a pivot table, it would typically appear only once.)\r\n\r\n**Column Labels:**\r\n- 2019\r\n- 2020\r\n\r\n**Values:** \r\n- The average 2015-18 compound annual growth rate in revenue for each sector for the years 2019 and 2020. For example:\r\n  - Technology in 2020: 81.8%\r\n  - Support Services in 2020: 80.9%\r\n  - Construction in 2020: 80.6%\r\n  - ... and so on for each sector and year combination. \r\n\r\nThe pivot table would allow you to quickly compare the growth rate of each sector across the two years and see the changes in growth from one year to the next."}
