To determine the update frequency and nature (real-time vs. periodic), you would typically need to refer to the source of the data. The image contains a reference to sources at the bottom, such as a YouTube link and a GitHub page, which might offer more information on the update frequency and methodology. For real-time or periodic updates, the dataset owners or maintainers usually specify this in the dataset documentation or on the website where the data is published."
