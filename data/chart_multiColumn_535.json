The chief inference from this bar chart is that about a third of Latinos say they now express their Hispanic or American identities outwardly more often than they did five years ago. The chart further breaks down this data by specific behaviors associated with Hispanic and U.S. identities and by political affiliation (Dem/Lean Dem vs. Rep/Lean Rep)."
