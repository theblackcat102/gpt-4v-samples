    "gpt": "The image you've provided is a slide from a presentation, seemingly from Citi, detailing their investment to support accelerated growth priorities. However, there are no curves or bar charts present on this slide to explain. It's a text-based slide divided into three main columns titled \"BUSINESS,\" \"INVESTMENT THEMES,\" \"PROGRESS TO DATE,\" and on the far right, \"KPIs\" with the subtitle \"17-21 AVG RoTCE\u00B9\".\r\n\r\nThe slide seems to outline strategic areas where investments have been made (e.g., in Treasury and Trade Solutions (TTS), Securities Services, and Global Wealth Management) and the progress made to date in each area. KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) related to these investment themes and progress are listed with average percentages next to them, suggesting performance metrics over the years 2017 to 2021.\r\n\r\nKey elements from the slide are:\r\n\r\n- Under \"BUSINESS,\" the areas of focus are \"TTS,\" \"Securities Services,\" and \"Global Wealth Management.\"\r\n- \"INVESTMENT THEMES\" details specific strategies like cross-border payments and integrated solutions for TTS, servicing capabilities for Securities Services, and hiring client advisors for Global Wealth Management.\r\n- \"PROGRESS TO DATE\" provides updates on these themes, such as the introduction of CitiConnect and instant payments in 28 markets for TTS, growth in assets under custody\/administration for Securities Services, and the hiring of new client advisors in Global Wealth Management.\r\n- The \"KPIs\" column lists metrics that indicate performance, such as \"Average Deposits\" and \"USD Clearing Volumes,\" with associated average return on tangible common equity (RoTCE) percentages like ~22% and ~26%.\r\n\r\nThe footnote indicators (like \u00B9, \u00B2, \u00B3, etc.) suggest there is additional information provided on these topics, which is likely detailed on slide 42 as noted at the bottom of the image.\r\n\r\nIf you need an explanation of the specific KPIs and metrics, you would need to refer to slide 42 or additional supporting documents from Citi that explain these footnotes and provide the context for these figures. There are no graphical representations of data on this slide to interpret."
