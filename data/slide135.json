According to KPMG's latest survey, there has been a notable rise since their 2017 survey in the number of companies that recognize climate change as a significant financial risk within their annual reports.\r\n\r\nFor the N100 group, which consists of the top 100 companies from a sample of the 100 largest companies by revenue in each of 52 different countries, there was an increase from 28% in 2017 to 39% in 2020. This is a 15-percentage point increase, indicative of an underlying trend where companies are starting to take climate-related financial risks more seriously in their reporting.\r\n\r\nEven more substantial is the shift seen within the G250 group, which represents the world's 250 largest companies. Here, the rate has jumped from 48% in 2017 to 56% in 2020, an 8-percentage point rise. Over half of this group now acknowledges climate risk in their financial reporting. \r\n\r\nThis significant shift can be partially credited to the influence of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), which has been pivotal in raising both corporate and regulatory awareness about the financial implications of climate change. The TCFD has developed recommendations for disclosing climate-related risks which have driven an increase in scrutiny and transparency of corporate disclosures on this issue. There is a growing momentum towards making climate risk disclosure mandatory in many jurisdictions around the world.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, KPMG IMPACT has conducted a deep-dive study on how the world's largest companies report on climate risk and their transition strategies towards a net zero carbon economy. This study offers a set of quality criteria for climate-related disclosures and analyzes how companies stack up against these criteria. It also provides insights and advice from KPMG's subject matter experts on effective reporting practices.\r\n\r\nFor supervisors or stakeholders interested in understanding how leading companies are responding to climate change in their financial planning and risk management, and how this landscape is evolving, this survey and the accompanying study could serve as a valuable resource. The documents not only reflect the current state of corporate climate change acknowledgment but also suggest a trajectory toward more comprehensive and standardized reporting in the future. Access to the full study is available through KPMG's dedicated link provided in the document."
