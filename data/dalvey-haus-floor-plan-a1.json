    {"gpt": "This floor plan depicts a two-bedroom apartment with the following structure:\r\n\r\n- The Master Bedroom is located on the left side of the floor plan, and it is adjacent to the Master Bathroom.\r\n- A Private Closet is accessible through the Master Bathroom.\r\n- Beside the Master Bedroom to the right is Bedroom 2, which has a direct door to the Common Bathroom.\r\n- The Common Bathroom is also accessible from the hallway for guests and occupants of Bedroom 2.\r\n- Across from the Master Bedroom and Bedroom 2, on the other side of the apartment, is the Living Room, which is a central space with a layout for a seating area and entertainment setup.\r\n- Next to the Living Room is the Kitchen, which appears to be a galley-style kitchen with counters on both sides and possibly a place for a refrigerator at the end near the entryway.\r\n- Adjacent to the Kitchen, there is a space designated as the W\/D, indicating a place for a washer and dryer.\r\n- On the bottom right of the floor plan is the Dining area, which is adjacent to the Living Room.\r\n- There is a Study area located in the lower-left corner, adjacent to the Living Room and near the entrance of the apartment.\r\n- The apartment has a small space labeled AC Ledge, which could be an outdoor space for the air conditioning unit.\r\n- The main entrance opens into a hallway that leads directly to the Living Room, with the Study on the left.\r\n\r\nAs for the target seller this floor plan might be aimed at, given the inclusion of two bedrooms, a master suite with a private bathroom and closet, and a separate study, this floor plan could be targeting small families, professional couples, or individuals who need an extra room for guests or a home office. The study adds appeal for those who work from home, while the second bathroom increases functionality for both residents and guests. The separate dining area and living room also suggest a target market that values a traditional and more segmented floor plan over an open-concept design."}
