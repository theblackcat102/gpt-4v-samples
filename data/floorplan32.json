    "gpt": "Floorplan Details:\r\n\r\n1. The floorplan features three bedrooms.\r\n   - Master Bedroom: Includes an ensuite bathroom.\r\n   - Bedroom 1\r\n   - Bedroom 2: Located adjacent to Bath 2.\r\n2. There are two bathrooms:\r\n   - Bath (ensuite to the Master Bedroom)\r\n   - Bath 2\r\n3. Living Area: A spacious section which can be used for relaxation, watching TV, or entertaining guests.\r\n4. Dining Area: Located adjacent to the living area, designed for meals.\r\n5. Kitchen: Features standard amenities with a refrigerator (F), oven (O), and a washer-dryer (WD).\r\n6. There are two additional utility or storage rooms labeled \"HS\".\r\n7. There's a secondary smaller kitchen or kitchenette near the entrance.\r\n\r\nIntended Market:\r\n\r\n1. The floorplan appears to be designed for families or shared living situations, given the presence of multiple bedrooms and a spacious common area.\r\n2. The secondary kitchen might indicate a design for multi-generational living, where two separate family units can coexist with a degree of independence.\r\n3. Alternatively, it could be aimed at renters or homeowners who might want to lease a part of their home, as the secondary kitchen and separate entrance provide the means for an independent living space.\r\n\r\nActivities Presumably Meant to Support:\r\n\r\n1. Daily Living: Basic day-to-day activities such as sleeping, cooking, dining, and relaxation are supported by the bedrooms, kitchen, dining, and living areas.\r\n2. Entertaining: The large living area and dining space can accommodate guests for social gatherings.\r\n3. Independent Living: The secondary kitchen and separate rooms allow for a degree of independence for occupants, supporting multi-generational families or roommates.\r\n4. Storage: The \"HS\" rooms can be used for storage, a small office, or other utilities.\r\n\r\nOverall, the floorplan is versatile and seems to cater to modern living needs, accommodating both families and shared living situations. The secondary kitchen and entrance add flexibility to the design, making it suitable for various living arrangements."
