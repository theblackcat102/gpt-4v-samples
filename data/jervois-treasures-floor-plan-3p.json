It also has direct access to the roof terrace, which occupies the top right section of the upper floor.\r\n- The junior suite is on the left side of the upper floor and includes an attached bathroom. It sits directly above the study and part of the dining area from the lower floor.\r\n- There is also an AC ledge adjacent to the junior suite.\r\n\r\nThe master bedroom is beside the roof terrace on one side and above the living area if considering vertical alignment with the lower floor.\r\n\r\nTarget Seller:\r\nThe duplex layout with a master suite and junior suite suggests this residence could be targeting buyers in the mid to high-end market, likely professionals or small families who value space, privacy, and the separation of living and sleeping areas. The presence of a study and utility room also indicates a consideration for practical living needs, possibly attracting work-from-home professionals or those who require a dedicated space for household management. The inclusion of outdoor spaces like a yard, balcony, and roof terrace suggests a selling point for those who appreciate outdoor living within a private residence."}
