    "gpt": "The image you provided is a financial forecast summary table for the years 2021E (estimated) to 2027E (estimated) for a company named Voltus. It doesn't contain curves or bar charts, but rather it is a table with various financial metrics. I'll explain each of the listed metrics and their significance:\r\n\r\n1. **Average MW Deployed**: This represents the average megawatts of capacity that the company has deployed each year. It's a measure of the company's output or productivity in terms of the energy capacity it has set up for use.\r\n\r\n2. **Average MW Registered**: This refers to the average megawatts of capacity that have been registered each year, likely with an energy grid or authority. This could indicate the capacity that is approved and ready for commercial operation.\r\n\r\n3. **$\/MW-year (Registered)**: This metric seems to be the weighted average market price realized for all registered MWs, which means the average revenue per megawatt per year from registered capacity.\r\n\r\n4. **$\/MW-year (Deployed)**: Similarly, this would be the weighted average market price realized for all deployed MWs, indicating the revenue per megawatt per year from deployed capacity.\r\n\r\n5. **Revenue**: This is the total income generated by the company from its operations before any costs or expenses are deducted.\r\n\r\n6. **Gross Profit**: It is the profit a company makes after deducting the costs associated with making and selling its products (revenue minus cost of goods sold).\r\n\r\n7. **Gross Margin (%)**: This percentage indicates the gross profit as a proportion of the revenue. It shows the efficiency of a company in producing and selling its products.\r\n\r\n8. **OPEX (Operating Expenses)**: These are the costs required for the company's day-to-day operations, broken down into Sales & Marketing, R&D (Research and Development), and G&A (General & Administrative expenses).\r\n\r\n9. **EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization)**: A measure of a company's overall financial performance and is used as an alternative to simple earnings or net income in some circumstances.\r\n\r\n10. **EBITDA Margin %**: This shows EBITDA as a percentage of revenue, giving insight into a company's operational profitability.\r\n\r\n11. **Plus\/(Less) Taxes, Collateral & Other**: This line likely includes adjustments for taxes, collateral held, and other financial activities that do not directly involve operating income.\r\n\r\n12. **Plus\/(Less) Working Capital**: Indicates the change in working capital, which is the difference between a company's current assets and current liabilities.\r\n\r\n13. **Plus\/(Less) Other Capital Costs**: This refers to additional capital costs that may include investment in property, plant, and equipment or other long-term assets.\r\n\r\n14. **Free Cash Flow**: The cash a company generates after accounting for cash outflows to support operations and maintain its capital assets.\r\n\r\nOn the far right column, you have the 2021-2027 CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) percentages for each of these metrics, which is a measure of the mean annual growth rate of an investment over a specified time period longer than one year.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding these metrics helps investors, management, and stakeholders get an insight into the company's performance, growth trajectory, and efficiency in deploying and registering energy capacity, managing costs, and generating profits."
