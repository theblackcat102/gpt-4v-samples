    "gpt": "The core idea of this slide is to present the projected growth of a company in three different areas: \"Annual Kits Sold,\" \"Cumulative Subscribers,\" and \"Cumulative Targets Through Validation.\" These metrics are separated into two categories labeled \"Consumer Opportunity\" and \"Therapeutics,\" suggesting that the company operates in two main sectors: consumer genetics (or similar products) and therapeutic solutions.\r\n\r\nThe \"Annual Kits Sold\" section shows a year-over-year increase in the number of units sold, starting from 1.5 million in FY21E and projected to grow to 2.5 million by FY24E.\r\n\r\nThe \"Cumulative Subscribers\" section illustrates a sharp increase in subscribers from 0.1 million in FY21E to an estimated 2.9 million by FY24E, indicating significant anticipated growth in the company\u2019s subscriber base over a four-year period.\r\n\r\nThe \"Cumulative Targets Through Validation\" section likely refers to therapeutic targets for drug development or similar areas that the company is working on validating. The growth is from 18 targets in FY21E to a projected 37 targets by FY24E.\r\n\r\nEach of these sections shows a significant upward trend, which suggests that the company is expecting robust growth across different aspects of its business in the near future. The slide also includes a footnote indicating that these figures are based on internal estimates subject to scientific, development, and compliance risks, and that the cumulative targets are adjusted for the probability of technical success. This information is provided to give context and indicate that the projections are not guaranteed but are the company's goals. The slide is marked \"23andMe Confidential and Proprietary Information,\" which indicates that the data is specific to 23andMe and should not be shared outside of authorized channels."
