        "gpt": "The people on the boats should consider the following safety precautions when they are on the river:\r\n\r\n1. Wear life jackets: Everyone on the boat should wear a life jacket, regardless of their swimming abilities.\r\n2. Avoid alcohol: Alcohol can impair judgment and coordination, increasing the risk of accidents.\r\n3. Be aware of weather conditions: Check the weather forecast before heading out and be prepared for sudden changes.\r\n4. Stay seated: Moving around can cause the boat to become unbalanced, especially in smaller vessels.\r\n5. Avoid overloading: Ensure the boat is not carrying more weight than it is designed for.\r\n6. Watch for obstacles: Be on the lookout for submerged objects, other boats, and any potential hazards.\r\n7. Use proper lighting: If boating at dusk, dawn, or night, make sure the boat has the correct lighting to be visible to others.\r\n8. Follow local boating rules: Familiarize yourself with the local rules and regulations for boating in the area.\r\n9. Carry communication devices: Have a working radio or a charged cell phone in a waterproof container.\r\n10. Equip the boat with safety equipment: This includes a first-aid kit, a whistle, a throw rope, and a fire extinguisher.\r\n11. Stay informed about water currents and tides: This can help prevent getting stranded or caught in a dangerous situation.\r\n12. Always tell someone your plan: Let someone know where you're going and when you expect to return.\r\n\r\nBy following these precautions, boaters can ensure a safer experience on the river."
