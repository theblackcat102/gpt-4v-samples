Dining area.\r\n6. Kitchen.\r\n7. Balcony.\r\n8. Yard.\r\n9. Two AC (Air Conditioning) units.\r\n10. WM (Washing Machine).\r\n11. WC (Water Closet).\r\n12. DB\/ST (likely a storage or utility area).\r\n13. F (likely represents a fridge or freezer).\r\n\r\nIntended Resident Profile:\r\nThe floorplan appears to be designed for a family or individuals who prefer spacious living. Given the three bedrooms, it could comfortably accommodate a small to medium-sized family, or perhaps roommates.\r\n\r\nLiving, Entertainment, or Work-Related Activities:\r\n1. **Living**: The Living area provides a space for relaxation, watching television, or casual conversations.\r\n2. **Dining**: Adjacent to the kitchen, the dining area is meant for meals. Its proximity to the kitchen makes serving and clearing easier.\r\n3. **Cooking**: The kitchen, labeled as \"KITCH-EN\", seems well-equipped with a stove (or hob), sink, and possibly a fridge.\r\n4. **Work or Study**: The presence of a Study area suggests that the house is designed to accommodate work-from-home or study activities. This space can be used for reading, computer work, or other desk-related tasks.\r\n5. **Outdoor Relaxation**: The balcony offers a space for outdoor relaxation, potentially for activities like reading, enjoying a morning or evening beverage, or simply getting fresh air.\r\n6. **Laundry**: The area marked WM is likely meant for laundry-related activities.\r\n7. **Storage**: The DB\/ST area provides storage space, which could be used for various household items.\r\n8. **Gardening or Outdoor Activities**: The yard can be used for gardening, playing, or even hosting barbeque parties.\r\n9. **Master Bedroom**: Being the largest bedroom with an attached bath, it offers privacy and can be used for relaxation, sleeping, or even watching television.\r\n10. **Other Bedrooms**: Bedroom 2 and Bedroom 3 can be used for kids, guests, or other family members. They can also double up as hobby rooms or personal spaces.\r\n11. **Bathrooms**: Apart from the usual functionalities, the presence of two bathrooms ensures there's no waiting, especially during rush hours in the morning or evening.\r\n\r\nThe layout promotes family living with spaces carved out for relaxation, work, dining, and outdoor activities. The inclusion of a study area particularly emphasizes the importance of work or study in the resident's daily routine."
