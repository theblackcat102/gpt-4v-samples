This is useful for understanding the true profitability and cost structure of each segment.\r\n\r\n2. **Trend Identification**: You can identify trends within each segment and the company as a whole. For example, you can see whether certain segments are improving or deteriorating over time in terms of profitability.\r\n\r\n3. **Segment Comparison**: By comparing the Pre- and Post-InterCo adjustments, you can assess the impact of intercompany transactions on each segment's reported EBITDA, which helps in evaluating the operational efficiency and interdependencies of the segments.\r\n\r\n4. **Budgeting and Forecasting**: The projections for 2022 and 2023 can help in setting budgets and making forecasts. If certain segments are expected to grow or contract, this may influence strategic decisions regarding resource allocation.\r\n\r\n5. **Decision Support**: Understanding the underlying EBITDA performance can support strategic decisions such as investments, divestitures, or restructuring within specific segments.\r\n\r\n6. **Financial Health Assessment**: The consolidated EBITDA figures show the overall financial health of the company. It helps you to understand whether the company is improving its core operations and if it is becoming more or less profitable over time.\r\n\r\n7. **Investor Communication**: This slide can be a tool for communicating with investors or other stakeholders about the company\u2019s performance and expectations, giving them clarity on how intercompany transactions influence financial outcomes.\r\n\r\n8. **Compliance and Reporting**: For internal and external reporting purposes, understanding these adjustments ensures compliance with financial reporting standards and provides a clearer picture of the company's financial position for auditors and regulatory bodies.\r\n\r\nOverall, this detailed breakdown is crucial for anyone needing to make informed decisions about the company's performance, strategic direction, and potential investments. It provides a clearer picture of operational effectiveness and the financial impact of intersegment relations, which is often obscured in consolidated figures."
