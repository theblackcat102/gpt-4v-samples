    {"gpt": "The primary message of the chart is to illustrate the growth trend in consumer spending on coffee in comparison to the actual consumption of coffee in Europe and North America from 2015 to 2020. Specifically:\r\n\r\n1. Total spending on coffee has been increasing steadily over the years, from 40.5 billion U.S. dollars in 2015 to an estimated 47.7 billion U.S. dollars in 2020, representing a 3% change in the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from 2015 to 2020.\r\n \r\n2. In contrast, the total consumption of coffee has remained relatively stable, with only a slight increase from 3.5 billion kg in 2015 to an estimated 3.7 billion kg in 2020, marking a 1% change in the CAGR over the same period.\r\n\r\nThus, the chart highlights that while spending on coffee has been on the rise, the actual consumption of coffee has not grown at the same pace, indicating that consumer spending is outpacing consumption."},
