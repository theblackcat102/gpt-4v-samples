        "gpt": "Glass jars are commonly used for preserving food because they are non-reactive, meaning they won't chemically react with the food they contain. They are also airtight once sealed, which helps to prevent the growth of harmful bacteria and preserves the freshness of the food. Additionally, glass jars are reusable, durable, and transparent, allowing one to easily see the contents. The clear visibility can be especially useful to quickly identify the preserved items and to check for any signs of spoilage."
