    "gpt": "The graph presents data from a study by Kleiner Perkins, dated 2018, focusing on actions taken by online consumers in the United States over the previous 12 months in response to data privacy concerns. The information suggests a significant awareness and proactive stance among consumers regarding their digital privacy.\r\n\r\nThe most common action, undertaken by 64% of respondents, was the deletion or avoidance of certain apps, indicating a predominant concern over the way apps handle personal data. This might reflect a growing skepticism about data usage policies of applications or perhaps a response to negative reports or personal experiences regarding data privacy.\r\n\r\nFollowing that, 47% of respondents adjusted their mobile privacy settings. This significant proportion reflects an active engagement with privacy features on mobile devices, showing that consumers are not just aware of privacy risks but are also taking advantage of available tools to manage their data exposure.\r\n\r\n28% of the participants chose to disable cookies, which are commonly used by websites to track user activity. This shows a significant proportion of the user base is inclined to limit tracking mechanisms, potentially impacting how businesses gather consumer data for advertising and analytics.\r\n\r\nA close percentage, 27%, reported not visiting or closing certain websites altogether, suggesting that privacy concerns can directly affect web traffic and, consequently, the success of online businesses. The implication is that websites' data handling transparency and practices can have a tangible impact on their user base.\r\n\r\nA slightly smaller segment of the survey population, 26%, took the time to closely read privacy agreements. While this is the lowest among the proactive measures, it still represents over a quarter of the respondents and indicates a desire to understand the terms of data usage before accepting them.\r\n\r\nLastly, only 9% of consumers reported not buying certain products due to privacy concerns. While this is a minority, it does highlight that data privacy can influence purchasing decisions and could have an impact on sales, especially for products that are closely tied to personal data use.\r\n\r\nIn summary, the data portrays a consumer base that is becoming increasingly privacy-conscious and is willing to take various actions to protect their personal information. For companies that rely on consumer data, this trend could signal a need to prioritize transparency and privacy in their business models to maintain customer trust and engagement."
