The character's eyes are visible and they have a bright blue hue. The character's tongue is playfully sticking out slightly. The attire consists of a black and cream-colored costume that includes a frilly, Victorian-inspired collar and cuffs. There is a black ribbon tied into a bow around the character's neck. A black cap, somewhat reminiscent of a beret, is worn on the head, tilting slightly to the side. In the background, you can observe curtains with a floral pattern and some blurred objects that might suggest an interior setting, possibly a room. The watermark \"@sally dorasnow\" appears on the image."},
