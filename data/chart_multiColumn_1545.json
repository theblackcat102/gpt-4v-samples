        "gpt": "From the diagram, we can draw the following conclusions:\r\n\r\n1. Among Democrats and Democratic leaners, 51% are concerned that congressional Democrats will focus too much on investigating the Trump administration, while 47% are concerned they will not focus enough.\r\n2. Among conservative and moderate Democrats, 55% believe there will be too much focus on investigations, while 43% believe there will not be enough focus.\r\n3. Among liberal Democrats, 46% believe there will be too much focus on the investigations, whereas 52% believe there will not be enough focus.\r\n4. The data suggests a division in opinion among Democrats, with a slightly higher concern about over-investigating among the total group.\r\n5. There is a noticeable difference in opinion based on the political leaning within the Democratic group: conservative\/moderate Democrats are more concerned about over-investigating than liberal Democrats."
