Fine-tune the styling (CSS) to get the exact appearance as seen in the screenshot.\r\n4. Add any interactivity or additional functionality you might need.\r\n\r\nRemember, this is a basic representation, and further adjustments will be required to achieve the desired look and functionality."},
    {"human": "What font should I use to look like this?"},
    {"gpt": "Based on the screenshot provided, it's challenging to identify the exact font used without additional context or a clearer image. However, the font has a classic, elegant, and clean serif style. \r\n\r\nHere are a few serif fonts that have a similar feel and are commonly used in design:\r\n\r\n1. **Baskerville**: A classic typeface that is elegant and highly readable. It has been used in many book designs and has a timeless feel.\r\n\r\n2. **Merriweather**: This is a free, open-source serif typeface available on Google Fonts. It is designed for readability both on screens and in print.\r\n\r\n3. **Playfair Display**: Another free font from Google Fonts, it's known for its high contrast and distinctive style, making it suitable for headings and emphasis.\r\n\r\n4. **Times New Roman**: It's a widely-used typeface, and while it might seem common, it does have an elegant, timeless feel.\r\n\r\n5. **Georgia**: A serif typeface designed for clarity on computer screens. It has a modern yet classic appearance.\r\n\r\nIf you're looking to match the exact font, the best approach would be to use font identification tools such as \"WhatTheFont!\" by MyFonts or \"Font Squirrel's Matcherator\". You can upload the image, and these tools will try to identify the font or suggest similar ones. \r\n\r\nOnce you identify or choose a font, you can integrate it into your Next.js application using CSS or by importing it from platforms like Google Fonts or Adobe Fonts, depending on its availability."}
