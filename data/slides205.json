In semiconductor design, Ion\/Ioff is a critical trade-off: Ion represents how well the device conducts electricity when it's 'on', indicating speed, while Ioff represents how much current leaks when it's 'off', affecting power efficiency.\r\n\r\nThe teal dots represent high-density device selection, which prioritizes efficiency over performance. We can observe a substantial decrease in leakage current (Ioff) with only a minimal reduction in drive current (Ion). At the 28nm universal curve point, the graph indicates a 48.8% normalized Ioff, which is reduced to 8.2% through the use of low leakage (high Vt) devices\u2014showing a significant improvement in power efficiency by reducing the off-state leakage current.\r\n\r\nThe orange dots represent high-performance device selection, which focuses on achieving higher speeds. The leakage here is less improved compared to the high-density selection, but the devices operate at higher speeds, as indicated by the smaller drop from the universal curve to the high-performance selection curve.\r\n\r\nMoving on to the graph on the right, we see the normalized frequency versus power consumption for an 8 GCN core GFX engine. The blue curve represents the high-density power-optimized design, while the pink curve indicates the high-performance legacy design. The graph illustrates that with power optimization, the new design can achieve the same frequency as the legacy design at lower power levels or, alternatively, a higher frequency at the same power level.\r\n\r\nThe key takeaway is that through the use of a 28nm device suite and optimized selection between high-density and high-performance devices, AMD has achieved an 18% leakage reduction. This has enabled a 10% higher frequency at the same power level, or a reduction of power consumption by up to 20% at the same frequency.\r\n\r\nIn summary, this slide demonstrates AMD's efforts to balance power and performance in their graphics processors. By selecting the right combination of high-density and high-performance devices, they have been able to significantly reduce power leakage and enhance operational efficiency without compromising on speed, which is crucial for energy-sensitive environments and can be a strong selling point for AMD's graphics products."
