    "gpt": "The image depicts two individuals, likely in a kitchen or culinary setting. Both are dressed in white attire, resembling chef's uniforms. The person on the left wears sunglasses and a red bow tie, while the person on the right, who seems to be tasting or eating something, wears a black bow tie. They are holding plates with what appears to be a fried food item. There's also a cooking station in front of them with a bowl containing some kind of liquid and a green object, possibly a decorative piece or container. Behind them, there's a traditional-looking wall with wooden decor. The overall scene suggests they might be involved in some form of culinary demonstration or cooking show."
