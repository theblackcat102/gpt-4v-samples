    {"gpt": "The image depicts two men standing at a workbench in what appears to be an industrial or workshop setting. The man on the left is holding a piece of paper or a document and appears to be discussing or showing something to the other man. This man wears a distinctive shirt with a floral pattern combined with a dark vest. The man on the right is in a blue work uniform, possibly indicating his role or position in this environment. He's interacting with some objects on the table, which include a rectangular device and other smaller items scattered around. There's also a tool, possibly a drill or similar equipment, located near the left-hand man. The background suggests a large workspace with windows, and there's a yellow safety line on the ground, which typically indicates a boundary or safety zone within industrial areas. The overall scene gives the impression of a collaborative or instructional moment, with both men seemingly engaged in a task or discussion related to the items on the table."}
