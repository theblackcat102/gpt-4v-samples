    "gpt": "Based on the analytics presented in this slide, the usual actions that might be undertaken are:\r\n\r\n1. **Performance Review**: Stakeholders would review the performance of each application area over the years to understand growth trends and identify strong and weak performers.\r\n\r\n2. **Strategic Planning**: Using the revenue projections, the company can make strategic plans for investment, resource allocation, and scaling operations in each application domain.\r\n\r\n3. **Risk Management**: The note at the bottom indicates a significant revenue dependency on one customer for Last Mile Delivery. The company may seek to diversify its customer base to mitigate this risk.\r\n\r\n4. **Sales and Marketing Focus**: The trends might influence where the sales and marketing efforts should be intensified. For example, seeing high growth in the Robo Taxi or ADAS sectors may lead to more aggressive marketing in these areas.\r\n\r\n5. **Contract Management**: The progression of signed contracts from 1 to 16 suggests an increasing customer base, which requires effective contract management to ensure fulfillment and customer satisfaction.\r\n\r\n6. **Financial Forecasting**: Projected revenue figures are crucial for financial forecasting and budgeting purposes. This would affect future expenditure, profit expectations, and investor relations.\r\n\r\n7. **Operational Scaling**: Large projected increases in certain areas (like the steep rise from 2022 to 2023 in Last Mile Delivery) might necessitate operational scaling, such as hiring more staff, increasing production capacity, or investing in new technologies.\r\n\r\n8. **Investment Decisions**: Seeing which sectors are expected to grow, the company might decide to invest more in R&D in these specific areas.\r\n\r\n9. **Pricing Strategy**: If certain applications are projected to grow significantly, the company might evaluate its pricing strategy for those services or products to maximize revenue.\r\n\r\n10. **Benchmarking & Goal Setting**: The company can use this data to set benchmarks for future performance and establish clear, quantifiable goals for the coming years."
