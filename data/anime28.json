    {"gpt": "To have the vision-enabled LLM articulate the style or genre of the image, you could use the following prompt:\r\n\r\n\"Please describe the style or genre of the provided image. Identify if it's a portrait, landscape, abstract art, or any other discernible category based on its visual elements and composition.\"\r\n\r\nAnalyzing the image you've provided: It appears to be a portrait-style image of an animated character with striking blue eyes and silver-blue hair. The character has an intense expression, and there are blurry red elements in the foreground, possibly representing petals or some form of atmospheric effect. This style is reminiscent of anime or manga artwork."}
