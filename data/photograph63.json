    {"gpt": "The image depicts a solar eclipse, specifically an annular solar eclipse. During an annular solar eclipse, the Moon passes between the Earth and the Sun. However, the apparent size of the Moon is smaller than that of the Sun, which results in the Sun appearing as a bright ring, or \"annulus,\" surrounding the dark disk of the Moon.\r\n\r\nYou can witness a solar eclipse from specific locations on Earth where the Sun, Moon, and Earth align in such a way that the shadow of the Moon is cast on the Earth's surface. The exact location and time depend on the specific path of the eclipse. Solar eclipses do not occur every month because the orbits of the Earth and the Moon are slightly tilted relative to each other, so they usually do not align perfectly to produce an eclipse.\r\n\r\nTo safely observe a solar eclipse, it's important to use proper eye protection, such as solar viewing glasses or eclipse viewers, to prevent damage to your eyes. Never look directly at the Sun without appropriate protection."}
