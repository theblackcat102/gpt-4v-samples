    "gpt": "This manga meme likely gets many likes due to its relatable content that touches on the perceived generational conflict between employers and the younger workforce. The meme features a dialogue that suggests a critique of companies by a younger person, flipping the script on the common stereotype that young people want everything without working for it. Instead, it points out that companies may also expect to get everything\u2014presumably labor or productivity\u2014from employees without fair compensation.\r\n\r\nThe juxtaposition of these opposing viewpoints humorously highlights the tension and ongoing discourse about work ethic, generational differences, and the value of labor. It resonates with many people who feel that their work is undervalued or that corporations often seek to maximize profit at the expense of fair wages and employee well-being. The format of the meme, using characters from a manga or anime series, adds an element of pop culture appeal, which often increases engagement and the likelihood of being liked and shared on social media platforms."
