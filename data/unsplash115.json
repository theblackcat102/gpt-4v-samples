Above the sphere is a slender section of the tower with antennas, which is also lit up. The backdrop is dark, possibly indicating nighttime. Based on its design and illumination, this tower appears to be a significant landmark or communication tower in a city. Given its distinctive appearance, it closely resembles the Kuala Lumpur Tower (Menara Kuala Lumpur) located in Malaysia."
