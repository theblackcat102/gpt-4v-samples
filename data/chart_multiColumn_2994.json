It appears to show the results of a survey, which asked respondents to choose between two statements reflecting their own views on how Russia is respected around the world. \r\n\r\nHere are the details from the chart:\r\n\r\n1. **Year**: The chart spans from the year 2012 to 2017.\r\n2. **Y-Axis Scale**: The scale on the y-axis ranges from 0% to 100%.\r\n\r\nThere are two statements and the percentage of respondents who agreed with each one for the years 2012 and 2017:\r\n\r\n1. **Statement 1**: \"Russia should be more respected around the world\"\r\n   - In 2012, 16% of respondents agreed with this statement.\r\n   - In 2017, 73% of respondents agreed with this statement.\r\n\r\n2. **Statement 2**: \"Russia is as respected around the world as it should be\"\r\n   - In 2012, no specific percentage is directly shown for this statement.\r\n   - In 2017, 56% of respondents agreed with this statement.\r\n\r\nThe remaining percentage for each year presumably represents those who felt neither statement was exactly right, but this is not directly stated on the chart.\r\n\r\nLastly, the source of this information is mentioned at the bottom as the \"Spring 2017 Global Attitudes Survey\" by \"PEW RESEARCH CENTER\"."
