    "gpt": "This is a page from a manga, which reads right to left and top to bottom, showing a sequence of four panels.\r\n\r\n1. In the first panel, a character with dark hair and what appears to be a shocked or anxious expression is shown. The character's eyes are wide and mouth slightly open, indicating surprise or apprehension.\r\n\r\n2. The second panel focuses on another character who is off-panel, only their mouth and chin are visible. This character is speaking to the first one, as indicated by the speech bubble that contains the text \"Hey, Shiki...\".\r\n\r\n3. The third panel zooms in on the first character's face. The sweat on the character\u2019s face and the exclamation points indicate an intensification of the character's shocked or startled reaction.\r\n\r\n4. The fourth panel reveals the second character's face with a broad, toothy grin and narrowed eyes that suggest mischievousness or playfulness. The character says, \"BE MY FRIEND.\" in a large speech bubble, which is the main focus of this panel. \r\n\r\nThe progression of the panels indicates a sudden and unexpected request for friendship, which has taken the first character by surprise."
