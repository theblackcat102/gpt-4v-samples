The forest surrounding the castle is densely populated with trees, all of which appear to be covered in snow, suggesting that the image was taken during winter. Above the forest, the mountains in the background also have a dusting of snow on their peaks. The sky appears overcast, which might indicate cold weather conditions. Overall, the scene conveys a serene and isolated ambiance."
