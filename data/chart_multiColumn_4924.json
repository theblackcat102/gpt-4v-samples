        "gpt": "The graph provides information about the number of public laws enacted by different sessions of Congress, dividing them into two categories: Ceremonial and Substantive.\r\n\r\nFrom the graph:\r\n\r\n1. The number of Substantive laws has been generally decreasing from the 106th to the 112th Congress, but there is a slight increase in the 113th Congress.\r\n  \r\n2. The number of Ceremonial laws fluctuates, but there isn't a consistent trend. It peaked during the 110th Congress and saw a significant drop in the 111th and 112th Congress. The 113th Congress has a slightly higher number than the 112th but lower than most of the previous sessions.\r\n\r\n3. The total number of laws (both Ceremonial and Substantive combined) has been on a declining trend from the 106th to the 112th Congress, with a small uptick in the 113th Congress.\r\n\r\n4. The 113th Congress is not the least productive in terms of the total number of laws passed when compared to recent times, as it has enacted more laws than the 112th Congress.\r\n\r\nOverall, while the exact number of laws varies, the trend indicates a general decrease in total legislation passed over the displayed sessions, with the 113th Congress showing a slight rebound."
