    "gpt": "The analytics depicted here are from Qualcomm's pro forma results showing adjustments to GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) earnings to reflect \"estimated when earned\" revenues from QTL (Qualcomm Technology Licensing). This kind of financial reporting is often used to give investors and analysts a view of a company's performance that may be more indicative of the ongoing business operations by excluding certain items that are viewed as non-recurring, irregular, or not necessarily indicative of future operations.\r\n\r\nBased on these analytics, the actions that are generally prompted could include:\r\n\r\n1. **Investment Decisions:** Investors may use this information to decide whether to buy, hold, or sell Qualcomm's stock. Pro forma results can influence perceptions of the company's operating performance and prospects.\r\n\r\n2. **Management Evaluation:** Company management may be evaluated on their ability to generate revenues and control expenses, as these pro forma results often exclude extraordinary items.\r\n\r\n3. **Benchmarking:** Analysts may compare these pro forma results against those of previous quarters or years, or against the results of other companies in the same industry.\r\n\r\n4. **Financial Planning and Forecasting:** The company may use these results for internal planning and forecasting future performance. The exclusion of certain items may provide a clearer picture of sustainable revenue and cost structures.\r\n\r\n5. **Performance Bonuses:** Executive compensation, which can be tied to financial metrics, may be influenced by these figures.\r\n\r\n6. **Credit and Financing:** Creditors might look at these numbers to assess the company's ability to service its debt.\r\n\r\n7. **Regulatory Compliance:** While these numbers are not GAAP, they still need to comply with the regulations for financial reporting, and thus may be scrutinized for the accuracy of representations made to investors.\r\n\r\n8. **Tax Planning:** The differences in income before and after adjustments may have implications for tax planning and liabilities.\r\n\r\n9. **Mergers and Acquisitions:** In M&A activities, these results may be used to value the company or negotiate terms.\r\n\r\n10. **Communications and PR:** The company's public relations strategy may leverage pro forma results to highlight positive aspects of the company's financial health.\r\n\r\nEach of these actions depends on the stakeholder's interest in the company and how they use financial statements to inform their decisions."
