These spaces can mimic the tight, hidden spots a cat might seek out in the wild for protection from predators or to stalk prey. The overturned umbrella provides a semi-enclosed space that the cat may find appealing. Additionally, the umbrella's material may be cool and comfortable, or the cat may simply be curious about this new object in its environment."
