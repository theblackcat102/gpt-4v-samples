You can illustrate this to your manager with the following storyline:\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\"Imagine we are on a journey through the lifecycle of innovative therapies, starting from mere concepts in the lab, evolving into potential treatments that could one day impact millions of lives. This is the roadmap of our company's ambition and scientific pursuit.\r\n\r\n**Immuno-oncology:** Here, we're focusing on a groundbreaking target, CD96, which is already paving its way through Phase 1. We have another project, P006\u00B9, indicating a promising candidate that's poised to move beyond preclinical trials. Additionally, there are multiple immuno-oncology therapies that we're nurturing through the preclinical stages.\r\n\r\n**Cardio Metabolic Area:** Our endeavors in cardio metabolic research are diverse, tackling NASH and dyslipidemia. For these conditions, we have multiple potential therapies, each of them in different development stages but all advancing with a shared goal: to confront the growing epidemic of metabolic diseases.\r\n\r\n**Immunology:** This is a broad and challenging therapeutic area, but our multiple projects are showing promise, and they're making steady progress through preclinical evaluation. It's a testament to our commitment to combating autoimmune diseases.\r\n\r\n**Neurology, Other:** Lastly, we have a robust selection of projects targeting neurological disorders and other diseases, reflecting our dedication to bringing forth solutions for some of the most complex and underserved areas in medicine.\r\n\r\nThe right side of the slide is not just a blank space; it symbolizes our future. The next milestones are 'Phase 1 Data' and 'First Time in Human' studies. These are not just goals; they are beacons that guide our journey from the lab bench to the patient's bedside. \r\n\r\nIn the footnote, we're reminded of our partnerships and the ownership of our programs, indicating that while we journey forward, we're not alone, and we're strategic about our innovations.\r\n\r\nAs of January 15, 2021, we stand on a solid foundation, with our research portfolio reflecting both diversity and depth across the board. Each colored bar represents a potential life-changing therapy in the making and each phase transition is a leap towards a healthier tomorrow.\"\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis narrative ties the image into a coherent story, emphasizing the progress, potential, and vision of the company's drug development pipeline."
