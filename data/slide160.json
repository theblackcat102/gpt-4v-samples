    "gpt": "The slide presents ASML's net system sales data broken down by technology, end-use, region, and number of lithography units sold. Here's an explanation of each component:\r\n\r\n1. Technology Breakdown (Pie Charts):\r\n- The pie charts illustrate the percentage distribution of sales by different technology categories for Q2\u201920 and Q1\u201920.\r\n- For Q2\u201920:\r\n   - EUV (Extreme Ultraviolet): 39%\r\n   - ArFi (Argon Fluoride Immersion): 41%\r\n   - KrF (Krypton Fluoride): 10%\r\n   - ArF Dry (Argon Fluoride Dry): 5%\r\n   - I-line: 1%\r\n   - Metrology & Inspection: 4%\r\n- For Q1\u201920:\r\n   - EUV: 22%\r\n   - ArFi: 52%\r\n   - KrF: 13%\r\n   - ArF Dry: 7%\r\n   - I-line: 3%\r\n   - Metrology & Inspection: 3%\r\n\r\n2. End-Use Breakdown (Pie Charts):\r\n- These charts represent the percentage distribution of sales by the end-use of the technology for Q2\u201920 and Q1\u201920.\r\n- For Q2\u201920:\r\n   - Memory: 38%\r\n   - Logic: 62%\r\n- For Q1\u201920:\r\n   - Memory: 27%\r\n   - Logic: 73%\r\n\r\n3. Regional Breakdown (Pie Charts):\r\n- These charts show the percentage of sales based on the geographical location to which the systems were shipped in Q2\u201920 and Q1\u201920.\r\n- For Q2\u201920:\r\n   - Taiwan: 21%\r\n   - China: 23%\r\n   - USA: 17%\r\n   - South Korea: 38%\r\n   - EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa): 1%\r\n- For Q1\u201920:\r\n   - Taiwan: 30%\r\n   - China: 19%\r\n   - USA: 15%\r\n   - South Korea: 29%\r\n   - Japan: 4%\r\n   - EMEA: 3%\r\n\r\n4. Sales in Lithography Units (Bar Charts):\r\n- These bar charts depict the number of lithography units sold by type for both quarters.\r\n- For Q2\u201920:\r\n   - EUV: 7 units\r\n   - ArFi: 17 units\r\n   - ArF Dry: 7 units\r\n   - KrF: 23 units\r\n   - I-line: 7 units\r\n- For Q1\u201920:\r\n   - EUV: 2 units\r\n   - ArFi: 16 units\r\n   - ArF Dry: 6 units\r\n   - KrF: 22 units\r\n   - I-line: 11 units\r\n\r\nThe data shows an increase in total sales from \u20AC1,584 million in Q1\u201920 to \u20AC2,439 million in Q2\u201920, and shifts in technology and regional distribution of sales, as well as the number of units sold per lithography technology type."
