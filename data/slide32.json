    "gpt": "This slide presents financial data related to profitability, specifically focusing on Contribution Profit and EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) across actual historical data and projected future data. Here is how you can use the information from each section:\r\n\r\n1. **Contribution Profit**:\r\n   - This metric represents the profit generated from net revenue after direct costs but before general, administrative, and other operating expenses.\r\n   - The bar graph shows actual Contribution Profit for 2018 through 2020, and projected for 2021 through 2023. The trend from 2020 to the projected 2023 suggests a strong improvement in profitability.\r\n   - The percentages above each year represent the Contribution Profit as a percentage of Adjusted Net Revenue.\r\n   - To make better decisions, look at the factors contributing to the positive trend and consider how you can continue or reinforce these trends. Also, analyze the drivers of the past losses to avoid similar issues in the future.\r\n\r\n2. **EBITDA**:\r\n   - EBITDA provides a view of the company's operational profitability by removing the effects of financing and accounting decisions like interest and depreciation.\r\n   - The bar graph shows a negative EBITDA in the years 2018 through 2020, but a projected positive EBITDA for 2021 through 2023.\r\n   - The percentages above the EBITDA bars represent EBITDA as a percentage of Adjusted Net Revenue. They suggest that the company is becoming more efficient, moving from a large negative margin towards a positive one.\r\n   - Use this information to assess the sustainability of the company\u2019s earnings. Consider what changes have been implemented since 2020 that may have turned EBITDA from negative to positive and evaluate if these changes are sustainable or need further adjustment.\r\n\r\n3. **Mobility Segment Note**:\r\n   - The note \"Mobility segment EBITDA positive since 4Q 2019\" highlights a specific area within the company that has been performing well and may continue to do so.\r\n   - This could inform decisions to allocate more resources to this segment or to analyze what strategies used here can be applied to other segments of the business.\r\n\r\n4. **General Analysis**:\r\n   - Assess the credibility of the projected figures based on past performance and external factors. The projections are not audited and the note mentions that the revenue on which Adjusted Net Revenue is based is subject to an ongoing PCAOB audit, implying some risk or uncertainty regarding these figures.\r\n   - Investigate what led to the improvements in Contribution Profit and EBITDA percentages. Was it cost reductions, revenue growth, or both? This can guide strategic decisions about investment, cost management, and pricing.\r\n   - Use the trend data to set performance benchmarks and create incentive plans for management that align with continued profitability improvement.\r\n\r\n5. **Decision-Making**:\r\n   - If you're in a management role, consider where investments have paid off and where costs could be cut without damaging revenue potential.\r\n   - If you're an investor, this slide may influence your assessment of the company's future value and the soundness of investing in it based on improving profitability metrics.\r\n\r\nIn summary, the information can be used to evaluate past performance, plan for future strategies, and make informed decisions on resource allocation, investment, and operational changes."
