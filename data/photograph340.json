The scooter on the left has a license plate reading \"MP A-6552,\" while the scooter on the right has \"MPB-6552.\" The scooters appear to have similar design elements, including the same color scheme, rear lights, and seats. They are parked behind a painted white line on the sidewalk, and other scooters are partially visible in the background."}
