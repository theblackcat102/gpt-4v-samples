    "gpt": "The cash flow statement from Benson Hill provided for the years ending December 31st for 2018, 2019, and 2020, can be explained to your boss as follows:\r\n\r\n**Operating Activities:**\r\nFor the period under consideration, the company reported increasing net losses each year, from $18,089,000 in 2018 to $43,910,000 in 2019, and then a significant jump to $67,159,000 in 2020. However, the adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash used in operating activities have varied year on year, suggesting that non-cash charges or changes in working capital are affecting the operating cash flows. Specifically, in 2020, while the net loss increased substantially, the adjustments were not sufficient to offset this loss, leading to an increase in net cash used in operating activities to $52,678,000, up from $13,363,000 in 2018 and $44,353,000 in 2019. The increasing net cash used in operating activities might indicate the company is investing more in its operations, or it could reflect increased costs or decreased efficiency.\r\n\r\n**Investing Activities:**\r\nThere has been a substantial increase in net cash used in investing activities, from $48,615,000 in 2018 to $100,672,000 in 2020. This suggests the company has been significantly investing in its growth, potentially in property, plant, and equipment or other long-term assets. The growth in the cash used suggests an aggressive expansion or modernization strategy.\r\n\r\n**Financing Activities:**\r\nThe net cash provided by financing activities has been the lifeline for the company, given the negative cash flows from operating and investing activities. The company has been able to attract substantial financing, with the cash inflow from financing activities growing each year, from $63,681,000 in 2018 to a notable $160,703,000 in 2020. This indicates investor confidence and the company\u2019s ability to secure funds to support its growth and operations.\r\n\r\n**Net Change in Cash:**\r\nDespite the increasing net losses, the company's cash position improved significantly by the end of 2020, with cash and cash equivalents at $9,743,000, up from $2,989,000 at the end of 2018. This improvement is largely due to the inflows from financing activities, which have more than offset the cash outflows from both operating and investing activities.\r\n\r\n**Supplemental Information:**\r\nThe cash paid for taxes was reported only in 2019, amounting to $5,000. There was also a considerable payment for interest in 2020, which was $4,685,000. This could be associated with the increase in financing activities, indicating that the company may have taken on debt with interest obligations.\r\n\r\n**Non-Cash Investing and Financing Activities:**\r\nThe company also discloses non-cash investing and financing activities, which include the issuance of preferred stock warrants and financing leases in 2020, and purchases of property and equipment included in accounts payable and accrued expenses. This indicates that the company is engaging in sophisticated financial instruments and strategies to manage its growth and capital structure.\r\n\r\n**Conclusion:**\r\nThe narrative presented to your boss should focus on the company\u2019s aggressive investment in growth, as evidenced by increased cash used in both operating and investing activities. The reliance on financing activities to support these investments has been successful so far, as indicated by the improved end-of-year cash position in 2020. However, the increasing net loss and cash outflows from operations may require attention to ensure the company\u2019s long-term sustainability and profitability."
