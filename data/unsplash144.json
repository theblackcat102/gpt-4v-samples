Such landscapes are typically found in places like Utah, Arizona, and New Mexico, where national parks like Arches, Canyonlands, and Monument Valley showcase similar geological wonders. These areas are known for their unique red rock formations, vast desert expanses, and iconic buttes and mesas. The presence of snow suggests it might be during the colder months, which can provide a striking contrast against the warm tones of the rocks. The American Southwest is rich in Native American history, with many of the lands considered sacred. The combination of natural beauty and cultural significance makes this region a popular destination for travelers, photographers, and nature enthusiasts."
