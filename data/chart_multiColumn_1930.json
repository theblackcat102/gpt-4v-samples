The number of unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. has been generally declining over the past decade. From a peak of 12.2 million in 2005, it dropped to 10.7 million in 2016.\r\n\r\n2. The number of unauthorized immigrants from Mexico specifically has also been on a decline. It decreased from 6.9 million in 2000 to 5.2 million in 2016. \r\n\r\n3. While the number of unauthorized immigrants from Mexico decreased, the number of unauthorized immigrants from other countries saw a general increase from 1990 to 2016. \r\n\r\n4. Over the years, there has been an increasing trend in the percentage of unauthorized immigrants who have been residing in the U.S. for more than 10 years. This percentage rose from 36% in 1990 to 66% in 2016.\r\n\r\n5. Conversely, the percentage of unauthorized immigrants who have been in the U.S. for 5 years or less has been decreasing. This dropped from 38% in 1990 to 18% in 2016.\r\n\r\nIn summary, the U.S. has witnessed a decrease in the number of unauthorized immigrants over the past decade, particularly from Mexico. Moreover, a larger proportion of these immigrants are now long-term residents, having lived in the U.S. for over a decade."
