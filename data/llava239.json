        "gpt": "These animals, a zebra and an ostrich, might be together in a shared enclosure for a few reasons:\r\n\r\n1. Space and Resource Efficiency: Zoos and wildlife parks often house animals together to make efficient use of space, especially if the animals have similar habitat requirements.\r\n \r\n2. Similar Natural Habitat: Both zebras and ostriches can be found in the grasslands of Africa. By housing them together, zoos can recreate a more naturalistic setting, which can be more enriching for the animals and educational for visitors.\r\n\r\n3. Enrichment: Introducing different species together can provide mental and physical stimulation, as long as they are compatible and do not pose threats to each other.\r\n\r\n4. Compatibility: Zebras and ostriches are generally non-aggressive towards each other, making them suitable for cohabitation.\r\n\r\n5. Visitor Experience: Combining species can offer visitors a more dynamic and interactive viewing experience.\r\n\r\nHowever, it's essential to note that the exact reason would depend on the specific circumstances and decisions made by the animal care professionals at the particular facility."
