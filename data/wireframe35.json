Branching out from the \"Enterprise Core Services\" are various SAP-related services, as well as other offerings. Here's a textual representation of the flow:\r\n\r\n1. **Enterprise Core Services**: This is the central node, from which all other services branch out.\r\n\r\n2. Directly connected to the Enterprise Core Services are:\r\n   - **SAP Hana Enablement Services**\r\n   - **SAP Successfactors Services**\r\n   - **SAP Hybris Services**\r\n   - **Transformational Changes Services**\r\n   - **SAP Template Design & Deployment Services**\r\n   - **SAP Cloud Platform Services**\r\n   - **SAP Base 90 Solutions**\r\n   - **DryIce**\r\n\r\nAll these services are interconnected with the central \"Enterprise Core Services\" node, indicating that they are primary offerings or areas of focus that a user or client can explore or engage with from the main service hub. The structure suggests a clear and organized presentation of the company's services, making it easier for users or clients to understand and navigate their offerings."
