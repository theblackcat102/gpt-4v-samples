    "gpt": "The slide presents information on the involvement of various countries and their businesses in sustainability efforts, specifically in the context of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It shows data indicating that the awareness and commitment to the SDGs are not limited to a specific region but have become a worldwide phenomenon.\r\n\r\nThe main message is that a significant number of companies, particularly in certain leading countries, are actively incorporating the SDGs into their business practices and reporting. This is highlighted by the statistic that 70 percent or more of the top 100 companies in these countries reference the SDGs in their sustainability reporting. Additionally, the slide includes insights from Japan, Thailand, and Taiwan on the role and impact of the SDGs in their respective business cultures and practices.\r\n\r\nJapan stresses the importance of \"Society 5.0\" which integrates big data, artificial intelligence, and robotics across all social segments to address societal issues. The Japanese perspective also notes the ease with which companies can connect their business strategies to the SDGs due to their reporting on material sustainability issues.\r\n\r\nThailand emphasizes the role of the SDGs in fostering a competitive yet positive environment among companies, particularly state-owned enterprises, leading to better sustainability performance. This competitive nature is partly attributed to the incorporation of SDGs into prominent local business indexes, like the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI).\r\n\r\nTaiwan points out the encouragement of incorporating SDGs into various aspects of business, such as innovation, business models, and operations, and the desire for more aggressive and integrated approaches to doing so.\r\n\r\nThe individuals quoted from each country\u2014Kazuhiko Saito from Japan, Paul Flipse from Thailand, and Niven Huang from Taiwan\u2014are partners at KPMG and specialize in Climate Change & Sustainability Services, providing professional insight into the integration of SDGs in business practices within their regions. \r\n\r\nThe slide's purpose is to inform viewers about the progress and approaches of different countries in aligning business practices with global sustainability goals, emphasizing the need for substantive integration of SDGs into business strategies, and not just superficial mapping."
