    "gpt": "The key message of the slide is that a significant portion of companies, 37%, anticipate a permanent decrease in their workforce size over the next 12 months. This expectation of workforce reduction is notably higher among companies with a pessimistic revenue outlook. Specifically, 54% of such companies expect both an immediate and permanent reduction in their workforce. Conversely, around 70% of companies with an optimistic revenue outlook plan to either increase hiring or maintain current workforce levels. Despite this, approximately 30% of companies that are forecasting revenue growth still expect to reduce their headcount, suggesting a trend of jobless growth where revenues increase without a corresponding rise in employment levels."
