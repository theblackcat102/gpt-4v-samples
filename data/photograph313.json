The lobster appears to be alive and wet, as evidenced by the water droplets visible on its shell and surrounding area.\r\n2. Human Hand: A hand, displaying a bracelet or bangle, is holding the lobster. The details of the hand include fingers, thumb, and part of the wrist.\r\n3. Tank: There seems to be a glass or clear plastic structure, likely a tank, from which the lobster has been taken or is being placed into. \r\n4. Signage: Above in the background, there's a sign that reads \"GADITAN RESTAURANT.\" The text is in green with a decorative element below the word \"RESTAURANT.\"\r\n\r\nThese are the main elements that stand out in the image. Let me know if you need more details!"}
