    "gpt": "This image presents two main graphical data representations related to a company's financial performance over three years: annual revenue and annual gross profit, along with their respective growth metrics and gross margin percentages.\r\n\r\nOn the left side, you have a bar chart illustrating the company's annual revenue in millions of dollars, which is unaudited, for three years labeled 2018A (Actual), 2019A (Actual), and 2020E (Estimate). The revenue in 2018 was $27 million, which grew to $83 million in 2019. This represents a year-over-year growth of 209%. The estimated revenue for 2020 is $138 million. Additionally, the chart indicates a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 128% over the three-year period, a metric used to describe the mean annual growth rate of an investment over a specified time period longer than one year.\r\n\r\nOn the right side, there is another bar chart depicting the annual gross profit in millions of dollars, also unaudited, with $8 million in 2018, $45 million in 2019, and an estimated $98 million in 2020. This section of the graph also features a dotted line indicating the percentage gross margin for each year. The gross margin has increased from 29% in 2018 to 54% in 2019 and is estimated to reach 71% in 2020. Furthermore, the graph shows a CAGR of 254% for gross profit over the three years.\r\n\r\nThe term 'gross margin' refers to the percentage of total sales revenue that the company retains after incurring the direct costs associated with producing the goods it sells, and the services it provides. An increasing gross margin percentage is generally a positive indicator of a company's improving efficiency and profitability.\r\n\r\nThe 'A' in 2018A and 2019A likely stands for 'actual,' referring to data that has already been realized. The 'E' in 2020E stands for 'estimate,' suggesting that the figures for 2020 are projected or forecasted numbers, not finalized figures.\r\n\r\nThe note at the bottom indicates that the company recognizes revenue under ASC 606 on a gross basis and that projections are before the contribution of recently launched and soon-to-be-launched business lines. ASC 606 is a revenue recognition standard that outlines how and when companies should recognize revenue.\r\n\r\nOverall, the graphs and the associated data are intended to convey a narrative of strong growth and improving profitability for the company, with significant year-over-year revenue increases, robust growth in gross profits, and expanding gross margins. The high CAGRs underscore a rapid expansion within the considered time frame."
