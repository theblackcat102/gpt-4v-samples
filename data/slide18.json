The metrics are presented to establish Grab's leadership position in terms of scale, growth, and profitability. Here\u2019s the breakdown of each segment:\r\n\r\n1. **Deliveries**:\r\n   - **Scale**: The Deliveries segment has a Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) of $5.5 billion for the year 2020.\r\n   - **Growth**: The compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of the Deliveries GMV from 2018 to 2020 is 203%.\r\n   - **Profitability**: The segment's profitability is indicated as 2H21, which suggests a target for EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) breakeven within the second half of 2021.\r\n\r\n2. **Mobility**:\r\n   - **Scale**: The Mobility segment has a GMV of $3.2 billion for the year 2020.\r\n   - **Growth**: It shows a 37% GMV growth from 2020 to the estimated 2022 end.\r\n   - **Profitability**: The Mobility segment's profitability is measured as 11% of GMV for the 4th quarter of 2020.\r\n\r\n3. **Financial Services**:\r\n   - **Scale**: This segment reports a Total Payment Volume (TPV) of $8.9 billion for the year 2020.\r\n   - **Growth**: The CAGR of the TPV from 2018 to 2020 is 102%.\r\n   - **Profitability**: Long-term profitability is projected at 30% EBITDA as a percentage of Adjusted Net Revenue.\r\n\r\n**Notes and Footnotes**:\r\n- It's mentioned that the scale, growth, and profitability metrics are pre-interco, which means they are calculated before accounting for intercompany transactions.\r\n- A footnote states that the TPV includes on-Grab and off-Grab transactions, which suggests that it encompasses payment volumes within and outside the Grab platform.\r\n- Another footnote indicates that the profitability metric refers to segment EBITDA before regional costs.\r\n- Finally, there\u2019s a disclaimer noting that these quarterly financial statistics are based on management accounts that have not been reviewed or audited and are subject to further review and updates.\r\n\r\nThis slide is likely used to convey Grab's robust performance and potential in its various business segments to investors or stakeholders. The metrics presented are crucial indicators of the company's market position, operational scale, and financial health."
