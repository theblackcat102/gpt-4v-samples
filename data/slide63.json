    "gpt": "The image is a slide presenting data from the 2022 Taiwan CEO Survey, showing how various non-financial outcomes are integrated into Taiwanese companies' strategies and CEO incentive plans. The data is segmented into two categories: those outcomes included in the company's long-term corporate strategy (represented by dark orange bars) and those factored into the personal annual bonus or long-term incentive plan for CEOs (represented by yellow bars). The percentage of companies that consider these factors in each category is displayed on the vertical axis, with the outcomes themselves listed along the horizontal axis. Here's the breakdown of the metrics:\r\n\r\n1. **Customer Satisfaction Metrics:**\r\n   - 80% of the companies include customer satisfaction metrics in their long-term corporate strategy.\r\n   - 38% factor customer satisfaction into the CEO's personal bonus or incentive plan.\r\n\r\n2. **Automation and Digitisation Goals:**\r\n   - 75% of the companies incorporate automation and digitisation goals into their long-term corporate strategy.\r\n   - 27% have these goals influence the CEO's personal bonus or incentive plan.\r\n\r\n3. **Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emission Targets:**\r\n   - 50% of the companies have included GHG emission targets in their long-term corporate strategy.\r\n   - A notably smaller portion, 8%, links GHG emission targets to the CEO's personal bonus or incentive plan.\r\n\r\n4. **Employee Engagement Metrics:**\r\n   - Employee engagement metrics are part of the long-term corporate strategy for 39% of the companies.\r\n   - 38% also include these metrics in the CEO's bonus or incentive plans, showing a close alignment between strategy and CEO incentives in this area.\r\n\r\n5. **Gender Representation Rates:**\r\n   - Gender representation rates are considered in the long-term corporate strategy by 30% of the companies.\r\n   - Only 8% of companies include this as a factor in calculating the CEO's personal bonus or incentive plan.\r\n\r\n6. **Race and Ethnicity Representation Rates:**\r\n   - 11% of the companies have race and ethnicity representation rates included in their long-term corporate strategy.\r\n   - The influence of this metric on the CEO's personal bonus or incentive plan is the lowest among the listed factors, at just 4%.\r\n\r\nThe slide also includes a key statistic at the top, stating that \"50% of Taiwanese companies have adopted GHG emission targets in their long-term corporate strategy, 8% have included them in their CEOs\u2019 bonus or incentive plans,\" emphasizing the particular focus on environmental goals within corporate strategies and the lesser emphasis on them in CEO incentives."
