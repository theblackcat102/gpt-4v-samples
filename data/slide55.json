    "gpt": "The storyline to present this information effectively to your manager could go as follows:\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Starting Point - Historical Growth and Strategic Acquisitions:**\r\n\"Back in 2010, we started with an EBITDA of $17 million. Over the course of five years, we have seen consistent growth. By 2011, we increased our EBITDA by 59% to $27 million. This was not a stroke of luck but the result of strategic decisions to manage costs and enhance our operational capacity.\r\n\r\n**Continued Success and Efficiency Improvements:**\r\nIn 2012, we built on that momentum, growing EBITDA to $34 million. It wasn\u2019t just about increasing numbers; our margin improved from 15% to 20%. We achieved this through stringent cost management and smart capital investments, indicated by our capital expenditures on maintenance and growth.\r\n\r\n**Strategic Investments Paying Off:**\r\nBy 2013, our growth trajectory continued, reaching $36 million in EBITDA. That same year, we made a significant acquisition\u2014the NG Orion\u2014for $30 million. This wasn\u2019t an expenditure; it was an investment. By 2014, this strategic acquisition started to pay off, contributing approximately $8-9 million annually to our EBITDA.\r\n\r\n**Present Situation and Future Outlook:**\r\nToday, we stand at an EBITDA of $45 million with a 22% margin, a stark increase from the 15% margin we had in 2010. Our Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) stands at an impressive 27%, a testament to our sound strategic decisions, cost management, and capacity scaling.\r\n\r\n**Conclusion and Moving Forward:**\r\nLooking ahead, the integration of NG Orion and the initiatives we've set in motion put us on a solid path for continued growth. The increase of over 700 basis points in our EBITDA margin in the last five years is just the beginning. With the scale we have now and the increased efficiency, we are set to anticipate even more in the years ahead.\"\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis narrative lays out a clear past-to-present progression of the company's financial growth, emphasizing strategic decisions, investment outcomes, and future prospects, making it easier for your manager to appreciate the journey and the company's strong position for future growth."
