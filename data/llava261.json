        "gpt": "There are three types of birds visible in the image:\r\n\r\n1. The larger birds with long legs and long bills are most likely some type of sandpipers or similar shorebirds.\r\n2. The white birds with shorter legs and bills appear to be gulls.\r\n3. The smaller birds with streaked patterns on their bodies, present among the larger shorebirds, could be another type of sandpiper or a related species.\r\n\r\nIt's important to note that without more specific details or a closer view, it's challenging to identify the exact species of these birds."
