        "gpt": "The image captures a vibrant scene on a road where two colorfully decorated buses, each adorned with intricate designs and text, are parked. One bus, prominent in the foreground, is predominantly red with yellow and blue stripes, while the other bus in the background boasts shades of blue and red. On the leading bus, the text \"Jocotales\" is discernibly written at the top front. The atmosphere is slightly overcast, evident from the grayish-blue sky, casting a soft light on the scene. Lush green trees form the backdrop, separated by a beige wall on the right. Two individuals are present: a woman with a backpack, captured mid-stride, looks down while walking past the bus, and a man in a red hoodie with \"OREGON\" printed on it stands nearby, looking at the camera with a neutral expression. The ambiance suggests a casual, everyday street scenario."
