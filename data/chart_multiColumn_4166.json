        "gpt": "The key takeaway from this infographic is a comparison of the number of U.S.-based journalists accredited by the Press Gallery to cover Congress in 2009 and 2014. Between these years, there was an increase in journalists from niche outlets and a decrease from daily newspapers, while foreign press and wire service numbers remained relatively stable. Broad-interest website journalists increased from 2 in 2009 to 73 in 2014. The total number of journalists also saw a slight increase from 1,658 in 2009 to 1,782 in 2014."
