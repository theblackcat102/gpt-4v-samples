    "gpt": "The image depicts a woman standing next to a scientific poster presentation. The main object is the poster, which is about clinical and histopathological features of necrotizing scleritis and severe endophthalmitis in three miniature poodles. The backdrop is a simple, light-colored display board with a header that includes the logo of National Taiwan University and other affiliations. The poster contains sections typical of scientific research presentations such as Purpose, Methods, Results, and Conclusion. It includes text with medical and scientific jargon, charts with timelines of disease progression, and photographs illustrating clinical cases with affected canine eyes at different stages. The style elements are academic and informational, designed for clarity and efficient communication of research findings. The color palette is professional and subdued, with blue tones dominating the charts, black text for readability, and red highlighting critical or abnormal findings in the images. The woman is professionally dressed, implying her likely involvement with the research, and her presence adds a human element to the scientific content of the poster."
