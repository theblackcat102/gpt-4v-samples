    "gpt": "The slide is presenting the revenue evolution for the Lanvin Group, showcasing a historical track record of revenue growth and highlighting the various growth drivers that are expected to contribute to future expansion. Specifically, the slide focuses on two brands within the Lanvin Group: Lanvin and Sergio Rossi, detailing their financial performance over fiscal years and projecting future revenue contributions by category.\r\n\r\nFor Lanvin:\r\n- There's a historical revenue figure shown from FY2020 to FY2021, with a significant increase from \u20AC32.7 million to \u20AC66.0 million.\r\n- The slide breaks down the growth in retail revenue, attributing an increase of \u20AC110.7 million to different areas: \u20AC26.5 million from like-for-like (LFL) retail stores growth, \u20AC30.0 million from China new retail stores, and \u20AC54.2 million from global new retail stores.\r\n- Other revenue streams for Lanvin include \u20AC44.7 million from wholesale and clearance, \u20AC16.6 million from e-commerce, and \u20AC26.0 million from cosmetics.\r\n- A projection for FY2025 is given, with an expected revenue of \u20AC264.0 million.\r\n\r\nFor Sergio Rossi:\r\n- The slide shows revenue growth from FY2020 to FY2021, with an increase from \u20AC47.9 million to \u20AC56.7 million.\r\n- Retail growth is reported to be \u20AC51.2 million, with \u20AC20.3 million coming from like-for-like retail store growth and \u20AC13.4 million from China new retail stores.\r\n- Additional revenue streams include \u20AC10.4 million from wholesale and \u20AC2.8 million from e-commerce.\r\n- The projected revenue for FY2025 is set at \u20AC130.6 million for \"Others,\" which may encompass all non-specified categories.\r\n\r\nNote: The historical figures are based on management accounts and are not audited under PCAOB standards. From 2021 and onward, the figures are management estimates. The note also clarifies that \"China New Retail Stores\" refers to revenue growth from new retail stores in the Greater China area excluding the Greater China area, which seems contradictory and might be a typo or error in the slide's text. Global New Retail Stores are explained to be the revenue growth from the new retail stores in regions outside the Greater China area.\r\n\r\nThe slide concludes with a reference to an appendix, suggesting that there is additional detailed information provided elsewhere in the document."
