        "gpt": "The image shows an airplane on the tarmac with some cloud formations in the sky. Given the visual information, potential risks associated with the current weather conditions might include:\r\n\r\n1. Thunderstorms: The presence of cumulus clouds can sometimes indicate developing thunderstorms which can lead to lightning, strong winds, heavy rain, and turbulence.\r\n2. Wind Shear: Sudden changes in wind speed or direction with height can affect aircraft during takeoff and landing.\r\n3. Crosswinds: If the winds are coming from a direction perpendicular to the runway, it can make takeoff and landing challenging.\r\n4. Reduced Visibility: Depending on the density and type of cloud formations, visibility could be reduced which can impact flight operations.\r\n5. Turbulence: Certain cloud formations, especially towering clouds, can indicate turbulent air.\r\n6. Temperature Extremes: Hot weather can affect aircraft performance, especially during takeoff.\r\n7. Wet Runways: If it has rained or if rain is expected, wet runways can affect braking and increase the risk of hydroplaning.\r\n\r\nPilots and airline operators always consider weather conditions and forecasts when planning and conducting flights to ensure safety."
