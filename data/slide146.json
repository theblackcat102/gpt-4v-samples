It showcases historical revenue and adjusted EBITDA figures to demonstrate a track record of strong financial performance and outlines the company's growth strategy. Specifically, the slide presents:\r\n\r\n1. Revenue (ex-TAC) and Adjusted EBITDA Growth: A bar chart shows the progression of revenue and adjusted EBITDA from 2015 to 2022E (estimated). The revenue has grown from $63 million in 2015 to an estimated $516 million in 2022E, while adjusted EBITDA has increased from $1 million in 2015 to an estimated $143 million in 2022E. This growth is further contextualized by noting the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for two periods, 2017-2020E and 2020-2022E, and the year-over-year (YoY) growth percentages.\r\n\r\n2. Rule of 40 Business: It mentions \"Rule of 40 Business\" which refers to a principle in the tech industry that suggests a company's combined growth rate and profit margin should exceed 40% as a benchmark for strong performance. \r\n\r\n3. Upside in Their Model: The slide explains that the model's optimistic projections are based on conservative estimates and potential gains from existing growth initiatives and other strategic actions. \r\n\r\n4. Long-Term Model: The company sets expectations for future performance, targeting over 20% revenue growth (ex-TAC) and over 30% adjusted EBITDA margin.\r\n\r\nOverall, the slide intends to communicate confidence in the company's financial health, growth trajectory, and strategic approach to achieve and sustain profitability."
