    "gpt": "The analytics presented in the image detail the lifecycle of a nuclear power plant and the involvement of Mirion Technologies\u2019 equipment throughout that cycle. The actions typically undertaken based on such analytics would likely include the following:\r\n\r\n1. **Strategic Planning:** The company would use this data to plan the development and production of its equipment to align with the different stages of a nuclear power plant's lifecycle, ensuring that the right products are available at the right time.\r\n\r\n2. **Sales Forecasting:** Mirion can predict revenue streams based on the lifecycle stages of a nuclear plant, which assists in financial planning and forecasting future sales.\r\n\r\n3. **Market Analysis:** With the information that Mirion's installed base covers ~90% of reactors worldwide and 100% in China, the company can analyze market share and target areas for growth or improvement.\r\n\r\n4. **Customer Relationship Management:** Knowing that there is significant revenue opportunity at each plant, the company can focus on maintaining strong relationships with existing customers to ensure repeat business and manage long-term service agreements.\r\n\r\n5. **Research and Development (R&D):** Identifying the products sold at each stage allows the company to focus R&D efforts on those products to ensure they meet the safety and regulatory requirements and to innovate in areas with the most financial impact.\r\n\r\n6. **Lifecycle Management:** Understanding the lifetime revenue opportunity per plant, Mirion can manage the replacement cycle for its products, ensuring that customers are prepared to replace or upgrade equipment when necessary.\r\n\r\n7. **Operational Efficiency:** By having visibility into the installed base, Mirion can optimize logistics and inventory for the replacement cycle of equipment.\r\n\r\n8. **Resource Allocation:** The company can allocate resources effectively, knowing when demand for certain products will increase, such as during pre-construction, construction, and decommissioning stages.\r\n\r\n9. **Contracting and Bidding:** Knowledge of the extended decommissioning phase and the associated revenue opportunities can guide the company in competitive bidding and contract negotiation for decommissioning projects.\r\n\r\nThe footnote on the chart states that it represents a typical 80-year NPP life cycle of a 3rd generation Westinghouse AP1000 design, and the chart is meant to provide insight into general scale and timing of expected revenue during the lifetime of a reactor. This insight guides the company in all the aforementioned actions and helps it position itself competitively in the nuclear technology market."
