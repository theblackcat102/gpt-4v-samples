        "gpt": "The fancy design on top of the coffee is called latte art. It serves several purposes:\r\n\r\n1. Aesthetic appeal: It makes the coffee more visually pleasing and can enhance the overall experience for the customer.\r\n2. Indication of milk texture and quality: Proper latte art can only be achieved if the milk has been steamed correctly to a smooth, velvety texture. Thus, good latte art can indicate that the milk has been prepared well.\r\n3. Skill demonstration: Baristas often take pride in their ability to create intricate latte art, and it can be a demonstration of their expertise and skill.\r\n4. Personal touch: It adds a unique and personal touch to each cup of coffee, making the drink feel special.\r\n5. Attraction for social media: Many people enjoy sharing pictures of their coffee on social media platforms, and a beautifully crafted latte art can make the coffee more photogenic and shareable."
