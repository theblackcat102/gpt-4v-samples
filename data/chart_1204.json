        "gpt": "The diagram shows a pie chart titled \"Nostalgia for Soviet Era\" and is based on a statement: \"It is a great misfortune that the Soviet Union no longer exists\". The pie chart represents the responses to this statement:\r\n\r\n- 50% of respondents \"Agree\" with the statement.\r\n- 36% \"Disagree\" with the statement.\r\n- 14% are \"DK\" (likely \"Don't Know\" or \"Undecided\").\r\n\r\nThis indicates that half of the respondents have a sense of nostalgia or believe it's unfortunate that the Soviet Union no longer exists, while more than a third disagree with that sentiment. A smaller proportion is unsure or did not express a clear opinion on the matter."
