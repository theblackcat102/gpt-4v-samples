    {"gpt": "The image shows a floor plan of a residential apartment. The layout is detailed with various rooms and spaces labeled to indicate their intended use. Here's a breakdown of the various components:\r\n\r\n- **Private Lobby:** A designated area leading into the apartment.\r\n- **Living Area:** A spacious area labeled \"LIVING\" that likely serves as the main living room.\r\n- **Dining Area:** Adjacent to the living area, marked as \"DINING II,\" for meals.\r\n- **Balcony:** An outdoor space accessible from the living area.\r\n- **Dry Kitchen:** A kitchen space designed for food preparation that does not involve heavy cooking, often for tasks like making sandwiches, salads, or using small appliances.\r\n- **Asian Kitchen:** This is presumably a wet kitchen, where more heavy cooking, especially typical of Asian cuisine which may involve frying or the use of strong aromatics, takes place. It is usually designed to be more resistant to moisture and has better ventilation.\r\n- **Yard:** An additional outdoor area, probably for utility purposes like laundry.\r\n- **Utility:** A small room often used for storage or sometimes as a maid's room, adjacent to the yard.\r\n- **Store + WC:** A storage space with a water closet (toilet).\r\n- **Master Bedroom:** The largest bedroom in the apartment, with an attached \"MASTER BATH\" for en-suite facilities.\r\n- **Bedroom 2, 3, 4:** Three additional bedrooms, each presumably smaller than the master bedroom. Bedrooms 3 and 4 share a common bathroom (\"BATH 3\"), while Bedroom 2 has its own bathroom (\"BATH 2\").\r\n- **AC Ledge:** A space outside the unit probably designated for air conditioning units.\r\n- **HS:** Not clearly labeled, but this could potentially stand for Household Shelter, a common feature in some countries where it doubles as a storage space and a protective shelter in case of emergencies.\r\n\r\nThe floor plan also includes various pieces of furniture to suggest the layout, as well as essential fixtures like refrigerators (marked \"F\"), washing machines (marked \"W\"), and sinks. There are also notes for lift access and several designated AC (air conditioning) ledges. It appears to be a comprehensive design suitable for a family, with clear distinctions between public and private spaces, utility areas, and communal living areas."}
