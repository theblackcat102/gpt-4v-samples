The years are spaced in intervals of 4 years, which is consistent with the timing of U.S. presidential and midterm elections.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the chart provides information about the voter turnout based on whether there is a Democrat or Republican president and differentiates between presidential and midterm elections with the help of line graphs and their respective colors."},
