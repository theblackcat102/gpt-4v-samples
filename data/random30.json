Here is a detailed explanation of the various components of this financial statement:\r\n\r\n1. **Earnings per Share (EPS)**:\r\n   - **Basic EPS** represents the amount of income earned by each share of common stock before considering the potential dilution from convertible securities.\r\n   - **Diluted EPS** takes into account the possibility of convertible securities (like options and convertible bonds) being converted into common stock, which would increase the total number of shares outstanding.\r\n\r\n   For the three months ended July 1, 2023, the basic EPS is $1.27, and the diluted EPS is $1.26. For comparison, the three months ended June 25, 2022, had a basic and diluted EPS of $1.20. The nine-month period ended July 1, 2023, shows a basic EPS of $4.69 and a diluted EPS of $4.67, slightly lower than the basic EPS of $4.86 and diluted EPS of $4.82 for the same period in the previous year.\r\n\r\n2. **Shares Used in Computing Earnings per Share**:\r\n   - **Basic** refers to the actual shares outstanding.\r\n   - **Diluted** reflects the total shares that would be outstanding if all dilutive securities were converted to shares.\r\n\r\n   There were 15,697,614 basic shares and 15,775,021 diluted shares for the three months ended July 1, 2023, indicating a slight decrease in shares from the same period in the prior year.\r\n\r\n3. **Net Sales by Reportable Segment**:\r\n   - **Americas**: The net sales in the Americas for the three-month period ended July 1, 2023, were $35,383 million, which shows a decrease from $37,472 million in the same period in 2022. However, the nine-month period sales increased from $129,850 million in 2022 to $122,445 million in 2023.\r\n   - **Europe**: There was also a decrease in net sales from $19,287 million to $20,205 million for the three-month period, and a decrease from $72,323 million to $71,831 million for the nine-month period.\r\n   - **Greater China**: This region experienced a decrease in net sales both in the three-month and nine-month periods, year over year.\r\n   - **Japan**: There was a slight decrease in the three-month period net sales and an increase in the nine-month period compared to the previous year.\r\n   - **Rest of Asia Pacific**: This region saw an increase in net sales for the three-month period but a slight decrease for the nine-month period year over year.\r\n\r\n   The total net sales across all segments for the three months ended July 1, 2023, were $81,797 million, a decrease from $82,959 million in the same period the previous year. For the nine months, there was also a decrease from $304,182 million in the previous year to $293,787 million in 2023.\r\n\r\n4. **Net Sales by Category**:\r\n   - **iPhone**: Sales of iPhones decreased slightly in the three-month comparison but increased for the nine-month period.\r\n   - **Mac**: Mac sales also saw a decrease for the three months but an overall increase over the nine months.\r\n   - **iPad**: iPad sales decreased in both periods year over year.\r\n   - **Wearables, Home and Accessories**: There was a slight decrease in sales in the three-month period and a more noticeable decrease in the nine-month period.\r\n   - **Services**: Apple's services saw an increase in net sales for both periods.\r\n\r\n   The total net sales by category match the total net sales by segment, confirming that the segments and categories cover the company's entire sales revenue.\r\n\r\nThis financial statement gives a snapshot of Apple's earnings and sales performance over specified periods, indicating slight declines in certain areas but also some increases in net sales in various categories and geographical segments. These figures are important for investors, analysts, and the company's management to understand the financial health and trajectory of the company."
