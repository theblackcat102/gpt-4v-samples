    {"gpt": "The prominent features of this drawing are:\r\n\r\n1. A hand-drawn animated character, which appears to be a female figure with a ponytail, wearing a dress. She is depicted in a stance that suggests she's shouting or expressing surprise or dismay.\r\n2. The character is positioned next to a large, realistically drawn red pencil.\r\n3. The tip of the pencil is very close to the character's mouth, almost as if she's being silenced or shocked by it.\r\n4. The character is holding what seems to be a tiny version of the same pencil in her hand.\r\n5. The contrast between the realistic pencil and the animated character adds a unique blend of real-life objects with imaginative depictions.\r\n6. The background is plain white, which places emphasis on the character and the pencil.\r\n7. In the bottom left corner, there's a numbered edition label, \"7\/100\", indicating that this might be a limited edition piece.\r\n8. The signature \"Niemann 2021\" is present in the bottom right corner, suggesting the artist's name and the year the artwork was created."}
