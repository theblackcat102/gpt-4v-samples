The inclusion of a study suggests that it could be targeted towards professionals who may need a home office. The two bathrooms provide convenience for both residents and guests, and the presence of both a dining area and a balcony or yard indicates an appeal to those who appreciate indoor and outdoor dining or leisure. Additionally, the separation of the bedrooms could be attractive for roommates who desire privacy."}
