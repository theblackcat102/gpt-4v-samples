        "gpt": "From the diagram depicting the \"Network Morning News Viewership\" over the years 2010 to 2013 for the networks ABC, CBS, and NBC:\r\n\r\n1. All three networks (ABC, CBS, NBC) experienced a decline in viewership over the period.\r\n2. ABC consistently had the highest viewership each year from 2010 to 2013, peaking in 2010 with 5.27 million viewers and declining to 4.73 million viewers in 2013.\r\n3. CBS had the second-highest viewership in 2010 and 2011 but was overtaken by NBC in 2012 and 2013. CBS's viewership went from 4.29 million in 2010 to 3.22 million in 2013.\r\n4. NBC's viewership remained relatively stable around 4.92 million for both 2011 and 2012 but saw a slight decrease in 2013 to 4.78 million, making it the second most-watched network in 2013.\r\n5. The decline in viewership for CBS was the most pronounced among the three networks from 2010 to 2013.\r\n6. The difference in viewership between ABC and NBC narrowed over the period, especially by 2013.\r\n7. The source of the data is Nielsen Media Research, and it's presented by the Pew Research Center.\r\n\r\nThese are the main conclusions that can be drawn from the given diagram."
