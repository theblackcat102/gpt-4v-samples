    {"gpt": "Certainly! Mermaid is great for generating visual representations through simple markup syntax. However, Mermaid's primary focus is on flowcharts, sequence diagrams, Gantt charts, etc., and it does not have native support for pie charts. Therefore, we will need to use an approximate representation.\r\n\r\nThe image you've provided looks like a pie chart, which Mermaid doesn't natively support. I'll provide you with a workaround using a flowchart representation:\r\n\r\n```mermaid\r\ngraph TD\r\n    A(82%)\r\n    B(18%)\r\n    C{ } --> A\r\n    C{ } --> B\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis representation will use blocks to indicate the two percentages. It's not an exact pie chart, but it's the closest we can get using Mermaid. If you specifically need a pie chart, you might need to consider other visualization tools or libraries."}
