    "gpt": "The analytics depicted in the image suggest that companies investing in Retail Media Network (RMN) advertising are largely focusing on Onsite (Owned & Operated) advertising tactics, with 91% currently running these. Given this information, companies may consider taking the following actions based on the insights from the data:\r\n\r\n1. **Increase Investment in Onsite (O&O) Advertising**: Seeing that a high percentage of RMN buyers prioritize onsite advertising, companies might decide to invest more in this area, assuming it yields a higher return on investment.\r\n\r\n2. **Evaluate Offsite Advertising Opportunities**: While onsite advertising is dominant, offsite display and video are also significant, with 73% and 63% usage, respectively. Companies may analyze the performance of these tactics and consider balancing their advertising mix accordingly.\r\n\r\n3. **Consider Email\/Newsletter Marketing**: Almost half of the RMN buyers are using retailers\u2019 email\/newsletter tactics. Companies might want to capitalize on this channel more if it aligns with their target audience and marketing goals.\r\n\r\n4. **Explore In-store Digital Out of Home (DOOH)**: With 46% already running and an additional 31% considering it, there seems to be a growing interest in in-store DOOH.

Companies might want to delve into why certain tactics are being considered and whether they should be tested or adopted based on the potential returns.\r\n\r\n6. **Strategic Planning**: If 63-73% of RMN buyers are running offsite tactics at least 15% more than other ad tactics, there is an implication that offsite tactics could be underutilized. This could prompt a reevaluation of the marketing mix to optimize the distribution of the advertising budget.\r\n\r\n7. **Research and Development**: The fact that some tactics are not being run or considered by a significant percentage of buyers might signal a need for more education on those tactics or for development to make them more appealing or effective.\r\n\r\n8. **Competitive Analysis**: Companies may perform a competitive analysis to understand why certain tactics are preferred and how they can differentiate themselves in a crowded marketplace.\r\n\r\n9. **Performance Review and Adjustment**: Regularly reviewing the performance of different RMN ad tactics to optimize the marketing strategy and reallocate the budget where it's most effective.\r\n\r\nIn summary, these analytics would typically prompt actions that revolve around optimizing advertising strategy, allocating resources effectively, exploring underutilized channels, and staying competitive within the market based on current trends and future considerations."
