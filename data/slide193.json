    "gpt": "The image displays a graph that represents the median pre-money valuation in millions of dollars (USD) for different series of venture capital funding in Europe from 2014 to an estimated point in 2022. Each line represents a different investment stage: Seed, Angel, Series A (A), Series B (B), Series C (C), and Series D and beyond (D+).\r\n\r\nThe lines indicate the trend in median valuation at each funding stage over time, showing how much companies are typically valued at before they receive new financing. Here's a breakdown of the lines:\r\n\r\n- **Seed Stage**: This line remains relatively flat and low, suggesting that the median valuation of seed-stage companies hasn't changed significantly over the years presented.\r\n- **Angel Stage**: Similar to the seed stage, the angel investment stage also shows a relatively flat line, indicating stable median valuations over time.\r\n- **Series A**: This curve starts slightly higher than seed and angel investment stages, remaining fairly constant, with a small increase over time.\r\n- **Series B**: This curve begins to rise around 2016, suggesting that the median valuations for Series B stages have been increasing.\r\n- **Series C**: The valuation starts to separate significantly from the lower rounds beginning around 2018, with a sharp increase in 2020 and continues to rise steeply.\r\n- **Series D+**: This line shows a dramatic surge in median pre-money valuation starting in 2021, indicating a significant jump in the valuation of companies at this stage of funding.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, there are annotations with dollar amounts at the end of some curves:\r\n\r\n- The Series D+ line ends with an annotation of \"$1,281.0M\", the highest valuation and indicative of the median pre-money valuation for companies in Series D or later funding rounds in 2022.\r\n- Series C ends with \"$268.0M\", which is the median valuation for companies in Series C funding rounds.\r\n- For Series B, it is \"$89.7M\".\r\n- Series A shows two amounts: \"$28.4M\" and \"$32.2M\" for 2021 and 2022, respectively.\r\n- Seed and Angel stages do not have any specific annotations for the final value.\r\n\r\nThe title \"Valuations remain unaffected by market turmoil as of yet\" suggests that despite any economic fluctuations or market instabilities up to that point in time, the valuations of companies at these various stages of venture funding have not been negatively impacted, and for later stages (C and D+), the valuations have significantly increased.\r\n\r\nThe footnote indicates that the data is sourced from Venture Pulse, Q3'22, KPMG's Global Analysis of Venture Funding, with the data provided by PitchBook as of October 19, 2022. It also notes that the figures for Series D or later valuations in 2014, 2015, and 2017 are based on non-normative population sizes, which means they may not be representative of the typical company size due to a smaller or unique subset of companies being evaluated for those years.\r\n\r\nLastly, the reference \"#Q3VC\" possibly denotes a quarterly venture capital report or analysis, and \"53\" at the bottom right suggests this is slide number 53 in a presentation deck."
