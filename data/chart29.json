    {"gpt": "The chart provides information about the fastest growing occupations in the U.S. over the projected period from 2019 to 2029. Here's a detailed breakdown of the chart's contents:\r\n\r\n1. **Title**: \"Fastest Growing Occupations in the U.S. Median Annual Pay & Its Growth Projection (2019-2029)\"\r\n\r\n2. **Visualization Style**: The chart utilizes a radial (or sunburst) style, with different segments representing different professions. Each segment has data about the median annual pay for 2019 and the projected median annual pay for 2029. The depth of the color indicates the growth rate of that particular occupation.\r\n\r\n3. **Growth Rate Color Scale**: The color intensity represents the growth rate:\r\n   - Deep Blue: 60% and more\r\n   - Moderate Blue: 50% - 59.9%\r\n   - Light Blue: 30% - 49.9%\r\n   - Orange: Less than 30%\r\n\r\n4. **Data Points**:\r\n   - Some occupations with their 2019 median annual pay, projected 2029 pay, and growth rate include:\r\n     - Statisticians: $91.6K (2019) -> $147.1K (2029) with 31% growth\r\n     - Solar photovoltaic installers: $42.7K (2019) -> $78.2K (2029) with 33% growth\r\n     - Medical scientists, except epidemiologists: $88.8K (2019) -> $133.3K (2029) with 32% growth\r\n     - Nurse practitioners: $109.9K (2019) -> $85.2K (2029) with a growth rate of 61% (This seems counterintuitive as the projected pay is lower in 2029. It might be an error or a special case).\r\n     - Wind turbine service technicians: $54.4K (2019) -> $85K (2029) with 34% growth\r\n     - Operations research analysts: $83.4K (2019) -> $106K (2029) with 25% growth\r\n     - Speech-language pathologists: $78.5K (2019) -> $105.5K (2029) with 23% growth\r\n     (And more professions are depicted on the chart.)\r\n\r\n5. **Source Citation**: The chart references the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics as the source of data, with a link to an article from howmuch.net that details the fastest growing occupations in the U.S.\r\n\r\n**In Summary**: The chart presents a visualization of the fastest growing occupations in the U.S. based on median annual pay and its projected growth from 2019 to 2029. The occupations highlighted are expected to see significant growth in pay over the 10-year period. The color coding makes it easier to identify which occupations are predicted to have the highest growth rates."}
