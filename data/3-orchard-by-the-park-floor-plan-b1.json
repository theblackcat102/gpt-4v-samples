    {"gpt": "This diagram shows a two-story floor plan for a residential unit. \r\n\r\nOn the lower level, there is a living area connected to a dining space. Next to the dining area is a dry kitchen, which is adjacent to an Asian kitchen, presumably designed for high-heat cooking or possibly with equipment and layout catering to Asian cuisine. There is also a yard area next to the Asian kitchen, which includes a water closet (WC) and a space labeled \"WD,\" which might refer to a washing machine or washer\/dryer setup. Additionally, there is Bedroom 3 and an associated Bath 3. The lower level also includes a storeroom or household shelter (HS), a balcony accessible through the living area, and a staircase leading to the upper level.\r\n\r\nOn the upper level, there is a master bedroom suite with a walk-in wardrobe and an attached master bath. There's also Bedroom 2, which has access to Bath 2. The upper level shows a void area, indicating an opening to the living\/dining area below, and an AC (air conditioning) ledge on the exterior part of the building.\r\n\r\nThe floor plan indicates a lift, suggesting that this unit is part of a multi-story building. The layout is quite modern, with an emphasis on open spaces and comfort, as indicated by the inclusion of en suite bathrooms and specialized kitchen spaces."}
