    "gpt": "The image showcases a collection of product packaging on a wooden surface with distinct sunlight shadows.\r\n\r\n**Main Packaging**:\r\n- It's a large, dark-colored bag with the dominant text \"NEXT PROTEIN\" and below it, the word \"DIET\" in a cursive font. There's a pink splatter design behind \"DIET\".\r\n- A pink sticker with Japanese characters is on the top-left of this bag, specifying it is \"SOY\" based. Underneath the text, it seems to indicate a serving size of \"20g.\"\r\n- At the bottom of this bag, there are four circular icons with inscriptions. From left to right:\r\n  1. \"SOY\" (with an icon suggesting its plant-based nature)\r\n  2. \"MCT \u30D1\u30A6\u30C0\u30FC\" (which means MCT Powder)\r\n  3. \"\u30B3\u30A8\u30F3\u30B6\u30A4\u30E0 Q10\" (meaning Coenzyme Q10)\r\n  4. \"GABA\"\r\n\r\n**Flavor Samples**:\r\nBeside the main packaging are three smaller packets, each labeled \"NEXT FLAVOR\" at the top. Below this text, there's a question: \"Which color do you like?\". Each packet represents a different flavor:\r\n- **Green Packet**: \"Uji-Matcha taste\"\r\n- **Orange Packet**: \"Caramel taste\"\r\n- **Brown Packet**: \"Chocolate taste\"\r\n\r\n**Color and Construction**:\r\n- The color palette mainly consists of earthy tones with the wooden backdrop being a rich brown. The product packaging stands out with its vibrant colors - pink for the main package's design elements and green, orange, and brown for the flavor packets.\r\n- The image seems to be taken from a top-down angle, allowing for all products to be clearly visible. The natural light casts gentle shadows, giving depth to the wooden surface and products.\r\n- The overall mood feels rustic due to the wooden background, combined with the modern packaging designs of the products."
