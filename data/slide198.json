    "gpt": "The slide you've presented appears to be from a presentation, most likely related to Nextdoor, which is a social networking service for neighborhoods. The data metrics involved on this slide include:\r\n\r\n1. **Local = 236K Nextdoor Active Neighborhoods ~ +2x in Two Years**: This indicates that there are 236,000 neighborhoods actively using Nextdoor, which has roughly doubled (+2x) over the past two years. The term \"active\" likely refers to neighborhoods with regular postings, events, or interactions on the Nextdoor platform.\r\n\r\n2. **Local Business Recommendations = 29MM, +71% Y\/Y**: This metric shows that there have been 29 million recommendations for local businesses made through the Nextdoor platform. The +71% Y\/Y (year over year) suggests that the number of business recommendations has increased by 71% compared to the same metric from the previous year.\r\n\r\n3. **Active Neighborhoods, Global**: This is a line graph that depicts the growth of active neighborhoods on a global scale from 2011 to 2019. The graph shows a significant increase, particularly steep from around 2017 to 2019, indicating rapid growth and adoption of the platform.\r\n\r\nThe graph's Y-axis (vertical) represents the number of active neighborhoods globally, though it doesn't provide specific numbers for each year; the X-axis (horizontal) is the timeline from 2011 to 2019. The curve shows a positive, accelerated growth rate, meaning that more and more neighborhoods are becoming active on Nextdoor over time, with the growth rate itself increasing.\r\n\r\nThe image on the left side shows a screenshot of the Nextdoor app interface, highlighting the local business recommendations feature with listings for plumbers, alongside user conversations and engagements related to local services.\r\n\r\nBelow the screenshot, there is a reference: \"Source: Nextdoor (5\/19). 29MM = Cumulative local business recommendations on the platform, up 71% Y\/Y vs. 17MM in 5\/18.\" This further clarifies that the 29 million figure is cumulative, and it's an increase from 17 million the previous year.\r\n\r\nThe slide number 54 at the bottom right suggests this is part of a larger presentation, possibly an investor deck or an annual report, detailing the growth and engagement metrics for Nextdoor."
