Here's a description of their arrangement:\r\n\r\n- There are doughnuts with a dark chocolate glaze. \r\n- Some doughnuts have a twisted shape, possibly crullers, and are glazed with a light color.\r\n- There are pastries that look like \u00E9clairs, which are long and have a chocolate topping.\r\n- There are also smaller round pastries, possibly cream-filled, with a dollop of pink icing on top.\r\n- Other round doughnuts appear to have a chocolate glaze on top.\r\n- A few doughnuts have a ring shape with no hole in the center and are glazed.\r\n\r\nThe pastries and doughnuts are closely packed together in the box, filling up the entire visible space. The arrangement seems random, with no specific pattern, and the items are layered on top of one another in some places."
