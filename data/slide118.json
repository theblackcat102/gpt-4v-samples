    "gpt": "The image displays financial data for a company named Impinj, presented as a pair of bar charts depicting the company's annual and quarterly revenue.\r\n\r\nOn the left side, there's a bar chart for \"Annual Revenue ($M)\", showing revenue in millions of dollars over a five-year period from 2017 to 2021. Each bar represents the total annual revenue for that year. The revenue appears to have a fluctuating trend: it increases from $125.3 million in 2017 to $152.8 million in 2019, then slightly decreases to $138.9 million in 2020, followed by an increase to $190.3 million in 2021.\r\n\r\nOn the right side, there's a bar chart for \"Quarterly Revenue ($M)\", which is divided into two sections: \"Systems\" and \"Endpoint ICs.\" This chart shows a more detailed breakdown of the company's revenue over the last six quarters, from Q3 2020 to Q3 2022. Each quarter's revenue is divided into two parts:\r\n\r\n1. \"Systems\" (the dark blue portion of the bar), which refers to the revenue from the company's reader ICs, readers, and gateways.\r\n2. \"Endpoint ICs\" (the light blue portion of the bar), which signifies revenue from other ICs (integrated circuits).\r\n\r\nFor each quarter, the combined height of the dark and light blue sections represents the total revenue for that quarter. The numbers on each bar segment represent the revenue amount in millions of dollars for that particular category. For example, in Q3 2022, the company earned $17.1 million from Endpoint ICs and $51.2 million from Systems, totaling $68.3 million for the quarter.\r\n\r\nThe note \"(1) Variations due to rounding\" indicates that the numbers on the bars might not add up perfectly due to rounding the revenue figures to the nearest decimal place or million.\r\n\r\nAt the bottom right, the \u00A9 2022 symbol indicates the year when this financial data was published or the slide was created. \r\n\r\nSlide number 13 suggests this image is part of a larger presentation, likely a financial report or an investor presentation, where the context for this data would be discussed in more detail."
