Apples: Cored and chopped into bite-sized pieces. \r\n\r\nYou can also drizzle some fresh lemon or lime juice to prevent the apples from browning and to add a zesty flavor. Optionally, top the salad with chopped mint leaves or a sprinkle of chia seeds for added nutrition and taste. Pair the fruit salad with a protein source, like Greek yogurt or a handful of nuts, for a balanced meal."
