    "gpt": "This slide is titled \"GEOGRAPHICAL EXPANSION\" and it's presenting a strategy for expanding to other countries outside the MENA region (Middle East and North Africa). The slide is divided into two sections with respective strategies for different regions:\r\n\r\n1. On the left, there's a map of South Asia, highlighting an initiative to \"BUILD LOCAL CHAMPIONS\" in countries excluding India, as indicated by the map. The highlighted area covers countries like Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and possibly Afghanistan and Nepal. This section is underlined by two bullet points:\r\n   - \"No major players\": This suggests that in these markets there isn't a dominant company or service provider in the relevant sector.\r\n   - \"Strong local preferences\": Indicates that the consumer preferences in this region are highly localized, so any expansion strategy would need to be tailored to fit these preferences.\r\n\r\n2. On the right, there's a global map focusing on serving the \"ARAB DIASPORA\" better. The map shows the spread of the Arab diaspora across the world, with the majority located in specific regions, as indicated by the dotted circles on the map. The approximate size of this diaspora is given as \"c.100MM\" which stands for \"circa 100 million.\"\r\n\r\nBelow the maps, there are three additional data metrics:\r\n\r\n   - \"30,000 subscribers\": Likely the current number of subscribers from the Arab diaspora the company serves.\r\n   - \"$2.8 ARPU\": Stands for Average Revenue Per User, indicating that each subscriber, on average, generates $2.8 for the company.\r\n   - \"0 marketing spend\": This suggests that up to the present or in the context of the provided figures, no marketing spend has been allocated or required, which might imply organic growth or other forms of non-paid expansion.\r\n\r\nThe curves and bar charts you're referring to are not explicitly represented on the slide. However, if you are referring to the visual elements such as the shaded regions on the maps, these are not bar charts but rather indications of geographic focus areas for the expansion strategy. The slide is aimed at conveying strategic information rather than specific data points through graphs or charts."
