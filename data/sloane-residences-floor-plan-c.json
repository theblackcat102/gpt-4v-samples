It shares a wall with Bedroom 3.\r\n- Bedroom 3 is beside the Master Bedroom and has its own attached bathroom.\r\n- Bedroom 2 is located on the opposite side of the apartment and has access to a balcony. It has an adjoining bathroom that can also be accessed from the dining area, making it a common bath.\r\n- The Living room is a central space with openings towards the dining area and has an adjoining balcony.\r\n- The Dining area is between the living area and the kitchen, with an entrance close to the common bathroom.\r\n- The Kitchen is divided into a Wet Kitchen and a Dry Kitchen, with the Wet Kitchen having an adjoining Utility space.\r\n- The entrance to the apartment opens into a Private Lift Lobby, which indicates that there is a direct lift access into the apartment.\r\n\r\nThis layout suggests that the target sellers for this apartment are likely to be buyers looking for a luxury living space with features like a private lift lobby, a master bedroom with an en-suite bathroom, a utility area within the apartment, and a split kitchen design which is often a feature in higher-end homes. The presence of a wet and dry kitchen suggests that the apartment is designed to cater to the needs of families who prefer to separate heavy cooking activities from lighter, cleaner ones. The apartment also seems designed to offer privacy between the bedrooms, indicating a target audience that values both communal living areas and private spaces."}
