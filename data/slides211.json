The key financial metrics shown are in billions of dollars and include:\r\n\r\n1. **Total cash, cash equivalents & marketable securities:** This indicates the liquidity of the company, showing how much cash or cash-like assets it has on hand. In September 2017, it was $38.6 billion, which has decreased significantly to $12.1 billion in September 2018.\r\n\r\n2. **Total assets:** This represents the company's overall assets, including both current and long-term assets. It shows a decrease from $65.5 billion in September 2017 to $32.7 billion in September 2018.\r\n\r\n3. **Stockholders\u2019 equity:** This is the amount of the company's assets that is owned by its shareholders (total assets minus total liabilities). It has dramatically risen from $0.9 billion in September 2017 to $30.7 billion in September 2018.\r\n\r\n4. **Debt:** This includes both short-term and long-term financial obligations. The company has reduced its debt from $21.9 billion to $16.4 billion in the given period.\r\n\r\n5. **EBITDA:** Stands for Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization, which is a measure of a company's overall financial performance. It's used to approximate the cash flow generated by the business. The EBITDA has decreased from $4.1 billion to $2.3 billion.\r\n\r\n6. **Adjusted EBITDA:** This metric excludes certain expenses or income that are considered non-recurring or not part of the regular business operations, giving a clearer view of the company's operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA has also decreased from $8.1 billion to $6.7 billion.\r\n\r\nThe asterisks and footnotes indicate there are specific definitions or conditions applied to how these numbers were calculated. For instance, the debt metric footnote clarifies that stock repurchases and repayment of long-term debt have significantly reduced cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. Additionally, the EBITDA definition is expanded to clarify what is included and excluded from this calculation."
