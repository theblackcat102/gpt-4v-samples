    {"gpt": "The chart titled \"The rise and fall of music formats\" displays the total annual revenue in billions of USD in the United States from 1973 to 2003. Here are the patterns and trends highlighted:\r\n\r\n1. **Dominance of Vinyl Records (1973 to mid-1980s):** From 1973 to the mid-1980s, vinyl records seem to be the predominant music format in terms of revenue, showing a steady increase until it peaks around the mid-1980s.\r\n\r\n2. **Emergence of Cassettes (Late 1970s to early 1990s):** Starting in the late 1970s, there's a noticeable rise in the revenue from cassette sales. This trend continues until the early 1990s, where it reaches its peak. After that, there's a sharp decline in cassette sales.\r\n\r\n3. **Dominance of CDs (Late 1980s to 2003):** The late 1980s mark the beginning of the CD era, with a sharp increase in revenue from CD sales. CDs quickly overtake both vinyl and cassettes to become the dominant music format in terms of revenue. This trend continues well into the 2000s, with CDs generating the highest revenue in 2003 at $11.3bn.\r\n\r\n4. **Decline of Vinyl and Cassettes (1990s to 2003):** There's a clear decline in the revenue from both vinyl records and cassettes starting in the 1990s. However, vinyl records experience a small resurgence around 2003, generating $0.04bn in revenue with the note \"Vinyl never dies.\"\r\n\r\n5. **Other Formats (Consistent Revenue Stream):** Throughout the years, there's a consistent, albeit small, revenue stream labeled as \"Other.\" This category reaches its highest point in 2003 with $0.5bn.\r\n\r\n6. **Noteworthy Mention in 2003:** The chart specifically mentions that in 2003, Norah Jones's \"Come Away with Me\" sold 11 million copies globally, highlighting a significant event in the music industry for that year.\r\n\r\nIn summary, the chart visualizes the changing preferences in music formats over three decades, from the dominance of vinyl in the 1970s and early 1980s, to the rise and fall of cassettes, and the emergence and dominance of CDs in the late 20th and early 21st centuries."}
