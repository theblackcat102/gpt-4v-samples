Both curves exhibit the typical behavior where increases in supply voltage lead to improvements in performance but at the cost of efficiency, and vice versa.\r\n\r\nEfficiency and performance are marked with stars at various points, corresponding to different operational frequencies of the chip's cores (0.52 GHz up to 1.05 GHz). This demonstrates that the chip's efficiency peaks at lower frequencies and voltages but decreases as frequency and voltage increase to achieve higher performance.\r\n\r\nIn summary, the Manticore chip offers a flexible platform with high FPU utilization and a balance between performance and efficiency that can be adjusted according to the user's needs, providing high computational power in an energy and space-efficient package."
